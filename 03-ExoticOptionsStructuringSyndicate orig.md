## User Story (STAR Format)

## User Story: From Challenge to Solution

### Situation
A Fortune 500 technology company with significant international operations faces unpredictable foreign exchange exposures due to global supply chain disruptions and volatile market conditions. Their treasury department needs to protect profit margins against adverse currency movements while maintaining flexibility if market conditions improve. Traditional hedging instruments haven't provided the optimal balance between protection and upside potential in this uncertain environment.

### Task
The Exotic Options Structuring Syndicate must design, price, and implement a $500M notional bespoke barrier option structure that provides downside protection against adverse FX movements while maintaining upside participation if currency markets move favorably. The solution must optimize premium costs within treasury budget constraints, meet accounting requirements for hedge effectiveness, and be efficiently executed and managed over a 12-month horizon.

### Action
The FX Derivatives Structurer begins by analyzing the client's exposure profile, proposing several barrier option designs with varying knock-in/knock-out levels. By combining put and call features, they create asymmetric risk profiles tailored to the client's specific needs and market view. Using the Numerix Python SDK, they initialize the client's exposure analysis:

```python
import numerix.crossasset as nx
import numerix.models as models
import numerix.market_data as md

# Initialize client profile and market environment
client = nx.Client(id="TECH500", base_currency="USD")
exposure_profile = client.analyze_exposure(
    currencies=["EUR", "JPY", "CNY", "MXN"],
    time_horizon=nx.TimePeriod(months=12),
    confidence_level=0.95
)

# Define barrier option structures
structures = []
for barrier_level in [0.90, 0.92, 0.95, 0.97, 0.99]:
    for barrier_type in ["knock_in", "knock_out"]:
        for option_type in ["put", "call", "collar"]:
            structure = nx.ExoticOption(
                option_type=option_type,
                barrier_type=barrier_type,
                barrier_level=barrier_level,
                notional=500_000_000,
                maturity=nx.TimePeriod(months=12),
                currency_pair="USDEUR"
            )
            structures.append(structure)
```

The Risk Analyst harnesses Numerix CrossAsset to simultaneously price over 50 barrier option variations, calculating comprehensive Greeks including delta, gamma, vega, and theta. They perform detailed scenario analysis across multiple market conditions and stress test each structure against extreme market movements to ensure robustness:

```python
# Configure model and market data
heston_model = models.Heston(
    mean_reversion=1.5,
    vol_of_vol=0.3,
    correlation=-0.7,
    calibration_method="market_implied"
)

# Price all structures using cloud-parallel computation
pricing_results = nx.parallel_price(
    structures, 
    model=heston_model,
    market_data=md.get_current_market_data(),
    compute_greeks=True,
    use_cloud=True,
    max_workers=50
)

# Run stress scenarios
stress_scenarios = [
    nx.Scenario(spot_shift=shift, vol_shift=vol, rate_shift=rate)
    for shift in [-0.5, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5]
    for vol in [-0.05, -0.025, 0, 0.025, 0.05]
    for rate in [-0.01, -0.005, 0, 0.005, 0.01]
]

# Execute stress tests in parallel across cloud infrastructure
stress_results = nx.parallel_stress_test(
    structures,
    scenarios=stress_scenarios,
    model=heston_model,
    calculate_var=True,
    confidence_level=0.99,
    use_cloud=True
)
```

Meanwhile, the Market Data Specialist validates FX volatility surfaces across all relevant currency pairs and ensures proper calibration of correlation parameters. They analyze historical barrier breach probabilities and provide market-based insights on option premium levels that inform pricing decisions and structure optimization:

```python
# Validate market data across currency pairs
relevant_pairs = ["EURUSD", "USDJPY", "USDCNY", "USDMXN"]
vol_surfaces = {}

for pair in relevant_pairs:
    # Fetch and validate volatility surface
    surface = md.get_vol_surface(pair)
    validation_result = md.validate_surface(
        surface, 
        min_points=20, 
        max_arbitrage_threshold=1e-6
    )
    
    if validation_result.is_valid:
        vol_surfaces[pair] = surface
    else:
        # Fix any detected issues in the surface
        vol_surfaces[pair] = md.repair_vol_surface(
            surface, 
            method="smoothing_spline",
            preserve_atm=True
        )

# Calibrate correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = md.calibrate_correlation_matrix(
    relevant_pairs,
    lookback_period=nx.TimePeriod(years=3),
    weight_scheme="exponential_decay",
    decay_factor=0.97
)

# Analyze historical barrier breaches
barrier_analysis = nx.analyze_barrier_breaches(
    currency_pairs=relevant_pairs,
    barrier_levels=[0.90, 0.92, 0.95, 0.97, 0.99],
    lookback_period=nx.TimePeriod(years=5),
    path_simulation_count=10000,
    plot_results=True
)
```

The Client Advisor works closely with the corporate treasury team to understand their specific risk tolerance and objectives. After thorough analysis, they present 3-5 optimized structure options with clear risk/reward profiles, negotiate final terms based on pricing feedback, and coordinate seamless implementation with ongoing post-trade support:

```python
# Select top structures based on client risk preferences
risk_profile = client.get_risk_profile(
    risk_tolerance="medium",
    max_premium_budget=15_000_000,
    accounting_constraints=["hedge_accounting_compliant", "minimal_p&l_volatility"]
)

# Identify optimal structures
optimal_structures = nx.optimize_structures(
    candidate_structures=structures,
    pricing_results=pricing_results,
    stress_results=stress_results,
    risk_profile=risk_profile,
    optimization_goal="max_protection_per_premium_dollar",
    max_results=5
)

# Generate client presentation materials
client_presentation = nx.generate_client_materials(
    structures=optimal_structures,
    client=client,
    include_payoff_diagrams=True,
    include_scenario_analysis=True,
    include_accounting_impact=True,
    format="interactive_dashboard"
)

# Execute final selected structure
executed_structure = nx.execute_structure(
    structure=optimal_structures[client_selected_index],
    execution_parameters={
        "max_slippage": 0.05,
        "execution_style": "twap",
        "execution_window": nx.TimePeriod(hours=3)
    }
)
```

Throughout the process, the team leverages Numerix's cloud capabilities on AWS to run simultaneous pricing scenarios, testing structures under various market conditions. This includes underlying price movements ranging from ±10% to ±50%, volatility shifts of ±5 vol points, interest rate changes of ±100bp, and barrier breach probabilities under multiple market paths to ensure comprehensive risk assessment.

The entire workflow runs on AWS Lambda serverless infrastructure, with each computational task distributed across dozens or even hundreds of simultaneous function instances:

```python
# AWS Lambda handler for pricing function
def lambda_handler_pricing(event, context):
    # Extract parameters from event
    structures = event['structures']
    model_params = event['model_params']
    market_data_key = event['market_data_key']
    
    # Initialize pricing model
    model = models.create_from_params(model_params)
    
    # Retrieve market data from shared S3 location
    market_data = md.load_from_s3(
        bucket="numerix-market-data",
        key=market_data_key
    )
    
    # Price assigned structures (each Lambda handles a subset)
    results = []
    for structure in structures:
        price_result = nx.price(
            structure,
            model=model,
            market_data=market_data,
            compute_greeks=True
        )
        results.append(price_result)
    
    # Write results to shared storage
    result_key = f"pricing-results/{context.aws_request_id}.json"
    nx.save_to_s3(results, bucket="numerix-results", key=result_key)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'resultKey': result_key
    }
```

The system's orchestration layer automatically distributes work across Lambda functions using Amazon SQS for message queuing and Step Functions for workflow coordination:

```python
# Orchestration function to distribute pricing tasks
def distribute_pricing_tasks(structures, model_params, market_data_key):
    # Split work into batches for parallel processing
    structure_batches = nx.utils.batch_items(structures, batch_size=5)
    
    # Create SQS queue for task distribution
    queue_url = sqs_client.create_queue(QueueName=f"pricing-tasks-{uuid.uuid4()}")
    
    # Queue tasks for Lambda functions
    for batch in structure_batches:
        task = {
            'structures': batch,
            'model_params': model_params,
            'market_data_key': market_data_key
        }
        sqs_client.send_message(
            QueueUrl=queue_url,
            MessageBody=json.dumps(task)
        )
    
    # Lambda functions are triggered by SQS messages
    # Each reads a batch from the queue and processes it
    
    # Monitor progress and collect results
    step_function_arn = start_monitoring_step_function(queue_url)
    return step_function_arn
```

The architecture dynamically scales based on computational demands. For stress testing scenarios, the system might spin up hundreds of Lambda instances simultaneously:

```python
# Stress testing coordinator
def coordinate_stress_tests(structures, scenarios, model_params):
    # Calculate overall computational demand
    total_computations = len(structures) * len(scenarios)
    
    # Determine optimal concurrency based on demand
    max_concurrency = min(1000, total_computations)  # AWS account limits apply
    
    # Set up DynamoDB for progress tracking
    progress_table = dynamodb_client.create_table(
        TableName=f"stress-progress-{uuid.uuid4()}",
        KeySchema=[{'AttributeName': 'id', 'KeyType': 'HASH'}],
        AttributeDefinitions=[{'AttributeName': 'id', 'AttributeType': 'S'}],
        ProvisionedThroughput={'ReadCapacityUnits': 100, 'WriteCapacityUnits': 100}
    )
    
    # Create cross-structure/scenario matrix and distribute
    tasks = []
    for structure in structures:
        for scenario in scenarios:
            tasks.append({
                'structure': structure,
                'scenario': scenario,
                'model_params': model_params,
                'progress_table': progress_table['TableName']
            })
    
    # Configure Lambda concurrency and burst capacity
    lambda_client.put_function_concurrency(
        FunctionName="numerix-stress-test",
        ReservedConcurrentExecutions=max_concurrency
    )
    
    # Distribute tasks through SQS for Lambda processing
    return queue_stress_test_tasks(tasks)
```

The results from all these distributed calculations are aggregated and processed in real-time, with the Numerix SDK handling data consistency and synchronization:

```python
# Result aggregator Lambda function
def aggregate_results_handler(event, context):
    # Fetch all result keys from S3 event notifications
    result_keys = [record['s3']['object']['key'] for record in event['Records']]
    
    # Load and merge all results
    aggregated_results = nx.results.merge_from_s3(
        bucket="numerix-results",
        keys=result_keys
    )
    
    # Perform post-processing analytics
    optimal_structures = nx.analyze_pricing_results(
        aggregated_results,
        optimization_criteria={
            'max_protection': 0.6,
            'min_cost': 0.3,
            'market_sensitivity': 0.1
        }
    )
    
    # Generate summary metrics and visualizations
    summary = nx.generate_result_summary(optimal_structures)
    
    # Store final results for client presentation
    nx.save_to_s3(
        summary,
        bucket="numerix-client-presentations",
        key=f"summary-{context.aws_request_id}.json"
    )
    
    # Trigger notification that results are ready
    sns_client.publish(
        TopicArn="arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:results-ready",
        Message=json.dumps({
            'summary_key': f"summary-{context.aws_request_id}.json"
        })
    )
```

This serverless architecture provides massive computational power on-demand without maintaining expensive infrastructure. The bank can process thousands of pricing scenarios in parallel, completing in minutes what would take days on traditional hardware. The scalability of AWS Lambda means the team can instantly provision the exact amount of compute resources needed for each analytical task, from simple pricing calculations to complex Monte Carlo simulations with thousands of paths.
