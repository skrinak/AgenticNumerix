## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
GlobalTech Industries, a $50 billion multinational technology corporation with operations in 28 countries, faces significant treasury challenges due to complex funding needs and exposure across multiple currencies and interest rate regimes. Recent market volatility has led to increased FX losses and higher funding costs, while an upcoming $5 billion acquisition and planned capital expenditure program are creating additional pressure on treasury operations. The CFO has mandated a comprehensive review and optimization of treasury functions to reduce costs, improve hedging effectiveness, and prepare for upcoming capital demands.

### Task
Design and implement a comprehensive treasury optimization strategy that minimizes funding costs and hedging expenses while effectively protecting against:
- Currency volatility (±20%)
- Interest rate shifts (±200bp)
- Credit spread changes (±150bp)
- Liquidity facility drawdowns

The solution must optimize hedging across 15 currencies and a $20B debt portfolio with 100+ potential funding structures, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for operational needs and supporting the upcoming acquisition financing.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we define the core agent structure using the Strands Agents SDK and integrate with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from strands_tools import calculator, file_manager, data_analyzer
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK
nx.initialize(
    license_key="YOUR_NUMERIX_LICENSE",
    api_url="https://api.numerix.com/v2"
)

# Create agent network for orchestration
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Corporate Treasury Optimization Command")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent has specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

```python

### Result

By implementing the Corporate Treasury Optimization Command system, GlobalTech Industries achieved:

1. **Cost Savings**: Reduced total treasury costs by 23 basis points annually, representing approximately $45 million in savings over a 5-year period. This included 9bp in FX hedging efficiency improvements, 7bp in interest rate management optimization, 5bp in credit facility restructuring, and 2bp from improved cash pooling arrangements.

2. **Enhanced Risk Management**: Successfully maintained hedge effectiveness above 90% across all major risk factors, with significantly reduced cash flow volatility from FX exposures. The optimized interest rate structure reduced earnings volatility by 22% under stress scenarios.

3. **Improved Liquidity Management**: Increased available liquidity by $1.2 billion through optimized cash pooling and credit facility structures, providing sufficient headroom for the upcoming acquisition without requiring additional emergency facilities.

4. **Optimized Capital Structure**: Redesigned debt maturity profile reduced refinancing risk by extending the weighted average maturity from 4.2 to 6.8 years while maintaining similar overall funding costs despite the longer tenors.

5. **Counterparty Risk Reduction**: Diversified counterparty exposures across 12 global banks with optimized collateral arrangements, reducing potential credit valuation adjustment (CVA) costs by 15% while maintaining banking relationships.

The CFO of GlobalTech noted that the system represented a significant advancement in their treasury capabilities, allowing them to achieve a level of optimization that would have been impossible with their previous manually-coordinated approach. The company has integrated the system into their quarterly treasury review process, enabling continuous optimization as market conditions and business needs evolve.
