# Pension Plan ALM Advisory Panel Use Case

## Overview
A multi-agent system designed to optimize asset-liability matching for pension funds dealing with changing demographics and market conditions. This system orchestrates specialized agents with domain expertise in actuarial science, investment strategy, risk management, regulatory compliance, and benefits administration to create a comprehensive asset-liability management (ALM) framework that balances funding requirements, investment returns, and risk management.

## Business Value
- Improved funding ratio targeting full funding within 15 years for a $100B pension plan
- Reduced contribution volatility while maintaining an 85% funding ratio
- Enhanced decision-making through specialized agent collaboration
- Ability to model 500+ economic scenarios across 50-year horizons with dynamic asset allocation rebalancing

## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
National Retirement System (NRS), a $100 billion pension fund responsible for providing retirement security to over 500,000 public sector employees, faces significant challenges with its current 85% funding ratio. Changing demographics with an aging participant population, increasing longevity, and a volatile market environment have created substantial pressure on the fund's ability to meet its long-term obligations. The board of trustees has expressed concern about the growing gap between assets and liabilities, as well as the increasing volatility in annual required contributions that is straining public sector budgets.

### Task
Develop a comprehensive asset-liability management framework that will achieve full funding within 15 years while keeping contribution volatility below 10%. The solution must account for:
- Longevity improvements (+3 years over current mortality assumptions)
- Interest rate fluctuations (±300bp)
- Inflation shifts (±200bp)
- Updated mortality tables
- Changing participant demographics (declining active-to-retiree ratio)

The framework must model 500+ economic scenarios across a 50-year horizon with dynamic asset allocation rebalancing to ensure the pension plan remains sustainable while minimizing the risk of significant contribution increases for plan sponsors.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we define the core agent structure using the Strands Agents SDK and integrate with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from strands_tools import calculator, data_analyzer, file_manager
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK
nx.initialize(
    license_key="YOUR_NUMERIX_LICENSE",
    api_url="https://api.numerix.com/v2"
)

# Create agent network for orchestration
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Pension Plan ALM Advisory Panel")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent has specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

```python

    actuary = Agent(

### Result

By implementing the Pension Plan ALM Advisory Panel system, National Retirement System achieved:

1. **Improved Funding Trajectory**: Developed a path to full funding within 15 years that increased the projected funding ratio from 85% to 100% through a combination of optimized contributions, liability management, and investment strategy. The probability of achieving full funding within the target timeframe increased from 45% to 87%.

2. **Reduced Contribution Volatility**: Decreased the projected contribution volatility from 15% to 8% year-over-year, providing plan sponsors with more predictable budgeting while still meeting funding requirements. This was achieved through a combination of liability hedging and dynamic asset allocation strategies.

3. **Enhanced Risk Management**: Identified and mitigated key risks through comprehensive scenario analysis. The stress testing framework demonstrated resilience to multiple adverse scenarios, including interest rate shifts, inflation spikes, equity market crashes, and longevity improvements. The integration of derivatives-based hedging strategies reduced funded status volatility by 40%.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Developed a regulatory compliance framework that satisfied all jurisdictional requirements while implementing the optimized ALM strategy. The reporting framework ensured transparent communication with regulators and facilitated necessary approvals for the revised funding and investment approach.

5. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Created a comprehensive communication strategy that effectively explained the ALM framework to all stakeholders including plan participants, sponsors, trustees, and regulators. This increased confidence in the pension system's long-term sustainability and reduced resistance to necessary changes in contribution rates and investment strategy.

The Chief Investment Officer of National Retirement System noted that the ALM Advisory Panel represented a paradigm shift in their approach to pension management, moving from siloed decision-making to an integrated framework where actuarial, investment, risk, regulatory, and administrative perspectives were unified through advanced analytics. The framework is now being used to conduct quarterly reviews of the pension plan's status, with the ability to make dynamic adjustments as market conditions and demographic trends evolve.
