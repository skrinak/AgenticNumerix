## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
Horizon Commodity Trading Advisors (HCTA), a mid-sized CTA with $850 million in assets under management specializing in systematic commodity futures strategies, was facing significant performance challenges due to persistent contango conditions across multiple commodity markets. Their flagship trend-following program, which had delivered solid returns for over a decade, had experienced three consecutive years of disappointing performance, with particularly severe underperformance during periods when futures curves were in steep contango. Analysis revealed that negative roll yield was eroding as much as 15-20% of annual gross returns in certain market segments, effectively nullifying the alpha generated by their trend signals. This performance challenge was becoming an existential threat to the firm as investors were beginning to question the viability of commodity trend-following in contemporary market structures. Compounding the problem, HCTA's research team had identified that traditional roll optimization approaches were becoming less effective as markets had evolved, with increased financialization and changing physical market dynamics altering historical contango/backwardation patterns. The CIO was particularly concerned about the energy sector, where persistent contango combined with high volatility was creating significant drag on performance. The firm needed to fundamentally reimagine its approach to futures curve dynamics, not just as a technical implementation detail but as a central component of their investment edge. With an important investor review approaching in 90 days and competition intensifying from newer firms with more sophisticated curve analytics, HCTA needed a comprehensive solution that could transform their understanding of curve dynamics and translate that understanding into actionable trading strategies.

### Task
Develop a sophisticated Commodity Futures Contango/Backwardation Impact Study system capable of modeling curve dynamics across 150+ futures markets while accounting for storage economics, convenience yield fluctuations, seasonal patterns, and market microstructure effects. The system needed to analyze historical performance attribution to identify where and when curve factors had most impacted returns, model how different curve shapes affected trading signal efficacy, and generate actionable strategies for optimizing positions and roll timing. It had to incorporate physical market data including storage costs, inventory levels, and supply/demand fundamentals to create a more holistic understanding of curve dynamics beyond simple statistical approaches. The solution needed to be flexible enough to adapt to different market regimes while providing concrete recommendations for portfolio construction, position sizing, roll optimization, and market selection. Additionally, it needed to enable HCTA to better communicate their enhanced approach to curve risk management to increasingly sophisticated investors. The goal was to develop a framework that would not only mitigate the negative impact of contango conditions but potentially transform curve dynamics into a source of alpha, helping HCTA preserve their legacy as a leading commodity trading advisor.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we established the core agent framework by integrating Strands Agents SDK with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx
import os
import json

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK with commodity and futures analytics modules
nx.initialize(
    license_key=os.environ.get("NUMERIX_LICENSE_KEY"),
    modules=["commodity_analytics", "futures_curve", "storage_economics", "market_microstructure"]
)

# Create agent network for the Commodity Futures Contango/Backwardation Impact Study
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Commodity Curve Impact Study")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent was implemented with specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

### Result

The implementation of the Commodity Futures Contango/Backwardation Impact Study system transformed Horizon Commodity Trading Advisors' approach to futures trading, delivering both immediate improvements in performance and long-term strategic advantages. Within the first quarter of deployment, the system's insights enabled HCTA to enhance its flagship program's performance by 570 basis points on an annualized basis through more sophisticated curve positioning and roll optimization strategies.

The Commodity Curve Modeling Specialist agent's analysis revealed that HCTA had been using oversimplified assumptions about contango and backwardation, treating them as binary states rather than nuanced conditions with multiple degrees and characteristics. The agent's sophisticated curve decomposition identified five distinct regime states across commodity markets with significantly different implications for trading strategies. Particularly valuable was the discovery that certain "mild contango" states actually offered better trend-following performance than some backwardated markets due to more persistent directional price moves. This insight led to a fundamental revision of HCTA's market selection algorithm, which now incorporated curve shape as a primary factor alongside momentum signals. The agent's regime transition probability models also improved timing of strategy adjustments, enabling the firm to adapt more quickly to changing curve dynamics before they adversely impacted performance.

The Storage Economics & Arbitrage Expert agent identified specific supply/demand conditions and inventory levels that preceded transitions between contango and backwardation regimes. By integrating physical market data, including global inventory reports, transportation costs, and storage utilization rates, the agent created early warning indicators for potential curve shifts. This provided HCTA with valuable lead time to adjust positions before curve dynamics changed. The agent also discovered profitable storage arbitrage opportunities in several agricultural markets where implied storage returns significantly exceeded physical costs, leading to the development of a complementary relative value strategy that generated uncorrelated returns during periods when trend signals were weak. This new capability helped diversify HCTA's return streams while maintaining their core focus on systematic futures trading.

Perhaps the most transformative impact came from the Roll Yield Optimization Strategist agent's complete reimagining of HCTA's roll methodology. The agent's analysis of historical roll yields across different commodities and market regimes revealed that the standard Goldman roll schedule was leaving significant value on the table, particularly in energy and industrial metals markets. By implementing dynamic, regime-dependent roll timing and optimized contract selection, the strategy captured an additional 320 basis points in annual roll yield compared to the previous approach. The agent also identified that roll costs were asymmetric across position direction, with long positions in contango markets suffering greater roll drag than short positions in backwardated markets benefited from positive roll yield. This insight led to the implementation of position sizing adjustments based on expected roll costs, effectively normalizing the strategy's exposure to curve effects.

The Market Microstructure Analyst agent provided critical insights into execution efficiency across the futures curve. The agent's analysis of liquidity distribution revealed that HCTA had been executing roll trades during suboptimal time windows when market impact was highest due to the presence of other large systematic traders executing similar rolls. By shifting execution timing and adopting more sophisticated execution algorithms specifically calibrated to each commodity's microstructure characteristics, the firm reduced transaction costs by 18% while simultaneously improving execution quality. The agent also identified significant liquidity premiums in certain deferred contract months that could be harvested through strategic positioning, leading to a new relative value overlay that improved risk-adjusted returns.

Beyond the specific tactical improvements, the system transformed HCTA's investor communications regarding curve risk. The comprehensive investor materials generated by the system became the centerpiece of HCTA's investor review meetings, providing clear, data-driven explanations of how the enhanced approach addressed the challenges of contemporary commodity markets. Investors responded positively to the firm's more sophisticated understanding of curve dynamics, with several large allocators increasing their investments based on the enhanced methodology. This investor confidence was further bolstered when the strategy successfully navigated a period of extreme curve volatility in the natural gas market, maintaining positive performance while many competitors suffered significant losses.

The long-term impact was evident in HCTA's ability to deliver more consistent performance across diverse market environments. By transforming curve dynamics from a performance drag into a source of alpha, the firm achieved its best three-quarter performance in five years, attracting $215 million in new assets. The board subsequently approved the expansion of the system's capabilities to include related commodity strategies, including relative value and option-based approaches, creating a comprehensive framework for commodity trading that positioned HCTA at the forefront of systematic CTA innovation.
