# Exotic Derivatives Pathway Dependency Matrix Use Case

## Overview
A multi-agent system designed for investment banks to analyze and manage the complex pathway dependencies in exotic derivatives portfolios. This system orchestrates specialized agents with domain expertise in path-dependent pricing models, exotic risk management, scenario generation, hedging strategy optimization, and market microstructure to effectively hedge exotic exposures, price new structures, and manage complex Greeks risks including gamma, vanna, and volga across diverse market conditions.

## Business Value
- Enhanced risk management for an investment bank with $5B notional in exotic derivatives
- Ability to run Monte Carlo across 10,000+ market paths for path-dependent exotics
- Optimized hedging strategies for complex pathway dependencies
- Improved pricing accuracy for new exotic structures
- Sophisticated management of higher-order Greeks risks

## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
Global Capital Markets (GCM), a major investment bank with a $5 billion notional portfolio of exotic derivatives spanning barrier options, autocallables, lookbacks, Asians, baskets, and other complex structures, faces significant challenges in managing path-dependent risks. Recent market volatility has exposed weaknesses in their existing risk management framework, particularly around barrier breaches, autocall triggers, and extreme market paths. The head of Exotic Trading has observed that while individual product pricing models perform adequately in normal market conditions, the interaction of path dependencies across the portfolio creates complex risk aggregations that are poorly captured by existing systems. Additionally, hedging effectiveness has deteriorated during market stress periods, with hedge slippage exceeding acceptable thresholds by 30-40% during recent volatility events. The bank's risk committee has flagged the exotic derivatives book as requiring enhanced risk management and hedging protocols to withstand future market dislocations.

### Task
Develop a sophisticated pathway dependency analysis framework capable of running Monte Carlo simulations across 10,000+ market paths for the exotic derivatives portfolio. The solution must enable the trading desk to:
- Identify critical price pathways and trigger events across the portfolio
- Optimize hedging strategies for complex path dependencies
- Accurately price new exotic structures considering existing portfolio exposures
- Effectively manage higher-order Greeks (gamma, vanna, volga) across market regimes

The framework must account for:
- Barrier breaches across various trigger levels
- Asian option averaging period dynamics
- Lookback option extreme value distributions
- Basket correlation shifts during stress periods

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we define the core agent structure using the Strands Agents SDK and integrate with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from strands_tools import calculator, data_analyzer, file_manager
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK
nx.initialize(
    license_key="YOUR_NUMERIX_LICENSE",
    api_url="https://api.numerix.com/v2"
)

# Create agent network for orchestration
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Exotic Derivatives Pathway Dependency Matrix")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent has specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

```python

### Result

By implementing the Exotic Derivatives Pathway Dependency Matrix, Global Capital Markets achieved:

1. **Enhanced Path-Dependent Risk Identification**: The system uncovered previously unrecognized interactions between barrier events across different products, identifying potential "risk cascades" where trigger events in one product could create knock-on effects through the portfolio. The analysis revealed that 23% of the portfolio had correlated barrier trigger levels, creating a significant concentration risk during specific market scenarios. The pathway dependency matrix provided a clear visualization of these interconnected risks, allowing traders to understand hidden risk concentrations.

2. **Optimized Hedging Strategy**: Developed a sophisticated multi-layered hedging approach that reduced the expected hedge slippage by 45% during stressed market scenarios compared to the previous approach. The system dynamically balanced vanilla and exotic hedging instruments based on liquidity conditions, cost considerations, and specific path risks. Most importantly, the hedging strategy now incorporated anticipated behavioral changes in Greeks near barrier levels, preparing for the non-linear risk explosions that previously caught traders off-guard.

3. **Early Warning System**: Created a trigger event monitoring framework that continuously tracks the portfolio's proximity to critical pathway thresholds, providing early warning signals 3-5 days before potential trigger events. This system incorporates both distance-to-barrier metrics and probability-based indicators derived from the Monte Carlo simulations. Back-testing demonstrated this system would have alerted traders to 85% of significant path events with sufficient time to implement risk mitigating actions.

4. **Improved Pricing Accuracy**: Enhanced the pricing models for new exotic structures by incorporating existing portfolio exposures and path dependencies. This holistic approach improved pricing accuracy by 20-30% during stressed market conditions, particularly for products with complex correlation dependencies. The model now correctly accounts for market impact and liquidity constraints when pricing large or complex structures, resulting in more realistic risk premiums.

5. **Execution Quality Enhancement**: Developed a microstructure-aware execution framework that reduced implementation shortfall by 35% when rebalancing exotic hedges. The system intelligently sequences hedge adjustments based on market liquidity conditions, breaking large rebalancing needs into optimal execution parcels. The framework also identifies alternative hedging instruments during liquidity stress periods, maintaining hedge effectiveness while avoiding excessive market impact costs.

The Head of Exotic Trading noted that the Pathway Dependency Matrix fundamentally transformed their risk management approach from a product-by-product view to a holistic pathway-focused framework. The ability to visualize interconnected risks across the exotic book, combined with granular Monte Carlo simulations targeting critical pathways, created unprecedented clarity around complex exotic exposures. Most importantly, the system's ability to detect and respond to emerging path risks has significantly improved the desk's performance during volatile market periods, with a 60% reduction in unexpected losses from path-dependent events compared to the previous year.
