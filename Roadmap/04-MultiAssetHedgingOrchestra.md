## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
Global Pension Trust (GPT), a $25 billion pension fund with a 30-year liability duration, faces significant risk exposure across multiple asset classes. The fund has liabilities denominated in multiple currencies, with varying durations and credit exposures. Recent market volatility has increased the urgency to implement a more sophisticated and responsive hedging strategy to protect the fund's funded status.

### Task
Design and implement a comprehensive multi-asset hedging strategy that optimizes cost-effectiveness while providing robust protection against:
- Currency movements (±15%)
- Yield curve shifts (±200bp)
- Credit spread changes (±300bp)
- Correlation breakdowns between asset classes

The solution must simultaneously analyze 200+ hedge combinations across FX forwards, interest rate swaps, and credit derivatives to identify the optimal strategy that minimizes hedging costs while maintaining effective risk mitigation.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we define the core agent structure using the Strands Agents SDK and integrate with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from strands_tools import calculator, file_manager
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK
nx.initialize(
    license_key="YOUR_NUMERIX_LICENSE",
    api_url="https://api.numerix.com/v2"
)

# Create agent network for orchestration
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Multi-Asset Hedging Orchestra")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent has specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

```python
# Portfolio Manager Agent
@app.entrypoint
def portfolio_manager_agent(request):
    # Create agent with portfolio analysis tools
    portfolio_agent = Agent(
        name="Eleanor Richards",

    )
    
    # Analyze portfolio exposures
    portfolio = nx.Portfolio.from_file(request.get("portfolio_file"))
    liability_structure = nx.LiabilityStructure.from_file(request.get("liability_file"))
    
    exposures = nx.analyze_exposures(portfolio, liability_structure)
    return {

#### 3. Orchestrate Agent Collaboration with Strands

```python
# Set up agent network for orchestration
def setup_agent_network():
    # Define the network topology and workflow
    agent_network.add_agent("portfolio_manager", portfolio_manager_agent)
    agent_network.add_agent("fx_hedger", fx_hedger_agent)
    agent_network.add_agent("ir_specialist", interest_rate_specialist_agent)
    agent_network.add_agent("credit_analyst", credit_analyst_agent)
    agent_network.add_agent("execution_trader", execution_trader_agent)
    
    # Define the workflow and dependencies
    agent_network.create_workflow([
        ("portfolio_manager", "fx_hedger", "exposures", "objectives"),
        ("portfolio_manager", "ir_specialist", "exposures", "objectives"),

    app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()
    
    # Register the main entrypoint
    app.register_entrypoint("multi_asset_hedging_orchestra", multi_asset_hedging_orchestra)
    
    # Process the incoming event through AgentCore
    return app.process_lambda_event(event, context)
```

### Result

By implementing the Multi-Asset Hedging Orchestra system, Global Pension Trust achieved:

1. **Cost Savings**: Reduced hedging costs by 47 basis points annually, representing approximately $118 million in savings over a projected 10-year period.

2. **Enhanced Risk Management**: Successfully maintained hedge effectiveness above 92% across all major risk factors, even during periods of extreme market stress.

3. **Operational Efficiency**: Reduced the time required to analyze and implement complex hedging strategies from 3-4 weeks to under 48 hours.

4. **Improved Decision-Making**: The collaborative multi-agent approach enabled more informed hedging decisions by incorporating specialized expertise across portfolio management, currency, interest rate, and credit domains.

5. **Stress Resilience**: Back-testing demonstrated that the optimized hedging strategy would have reduced drawdowns by 35% during historical stress periods, including the 2020 COVID market turmoil.

The pension fund's CIO noted that the system represented a significant advancement in their risk management capabilities, allowing them to dynamically adjust hedging strategies in response to changing market conditions while maintaining optimal cost efficiency.
