Elena conducts comparative analysis of business lines based on capital efficiency, designs incentive structures that reward capital-efficient trading activities, and helps prioritize business growth or contraction decisions based on regulatory capital impact. She also creates executive dashboards to communicate capital efficiency metrics to senior management and engages with business heads to develop strategic plans for optimizing their capital footprint.

## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
GlobalBank, a leading international investment bank with over $1 trillion in assets, faced an unprecedented challenge to its trading businesses following the full implementation of Basel III and the approaching deadline for the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB). The bank's trading operations spanned equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, and structured products across three major regions and twelve country offices. Despite generating $6.5 billion in annual trading revenue, the division's return on equity had declined from 18% to 11% over three years, primarily due to increased capital requirements. Risk-weighted assets for the trading book had grown from $120 billion to $175 billion despite efforts to reduce positions, driving down returns and prompting difficult strategic questions about which businesses to maintain, grow, or exit. The bank's existing approach to capital optimization relied on disconnected spreadsheet models, inconsistent metrics across desks, and reactive rather than proactive strategies. Senior management was under pressure from investors to improve returns and needed to make difficult decisions about resource allocation across businesses with different capital profiles. Trading desk heads lacked real-time visibility into how their activities affected the bank's overall capital position, resulting in sub-optimal trading strategies from a capital perspective. The situation had become critical, with the board demanding a comprehensive strategy to improve trading book ROE to at least 15% within 18 months without significantly increasing risk profiles or abandoning core client franchises.

### Task
Develop a sophisticated Basel III Capital Ratio Optimization Engine capable of modeling and optimizing regulatory capital consumption across 500+ portfolio configurations under multiple complex regulatory constraints. The system needed to calculate risk-weighted assets under various approaches including standardized and internal models, model the impact of different trading strategies on capital ratios, and identify optimal portfolio allocations to maximize return on equity. It had to incorporate stress testing to ensure resilience under adverse conditions, analyze the impact of FRTB implementation on capital requirements, and provide actionable recommendations at both strategic and tactical levels. The system needed to integrate with GlobalBank's existing trading and risk systems, operate with minimal latency to support near real-time decision making, and provide intuitive interfaces for both senior management and desk-level traders. The goal was to reduce RWAs by at least 15% without compromising revenue, increase trading book ROE by 400 basis points, and establish a sustainable framework for capital-aware trading strategies across the organization.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we established the core agent framework by integrating Strands Agents SDK with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx
import os
import json

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK with regulatory capital modules
nx.initialize(
    license_key=os.environ.get("NUMERIX_LICENSE_KEY"),
    modules=["regulatory_capital", "basel_framework", "trading_analytics", "portfolio_optimization"]
)

# Create agent network for the Basel III Capital Ratio Optimization Engine
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Basel III Capital Ratio Optimization Engine")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent was implemented with specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

### Result

The implementation of the Basel III Capital Ratio Optimization Engine transformed GlobalBank's approach to trading book management, delivering both immediate and strategic benefits. Within the first quarter of deployment, the system identified and executed opportunities that reduced risk-weighted assets by 12.5% while maintaining overall trading revenue, an achievement that had seemed impossible with previous approaches. This RWA reduction, combined with more strategic capital allocation, increased the trading division's return on equity from 11% to 14.2%, a substantial move toward the 15% target set by the board.

The Regulatory Framework Specialist agent played a crucial role by identifying specific areas where GlobalBank was applying unnecessarily conservative interpretations of Basel rules. By aligning more precisely with regulatory requirements while remaining fully compliant, the bank was able to release over $7 billion in RWA without changing its actual risk profile. The agent also provided invaluable insights into upcoming FRTB implementation, enabling the bank to begin strategic repositioning eighteen months before the rules took effect, rather than scrambling to comply at the last minute.

The RWA Modeling Expert agent discovered significant opportunities for optimization through more sophisticated netting arrangements across counterparties. By restructuring certain trading relationships and legal agreements, the bank was able to improve netting efficiency by 24%, reducing counterparty credit risk RWA by over $3.5 billion. Additionally, the agent identified and corrected several model inconsistencies that had been causing RWA calculation errors, resulting in more accurate capital allocation and elimination of unnecessary buffers.

Perhaps the most transformative impact came from the Portfolio Construction Strategist agent, which redesigned the bank's approach to portfolio construction and hedging. The agent identified multiple instances where traditional hedging approaches were actually inefficient from a capital perspective. By implementing more capital-efficient hedging strategies, GlobalBank was able to maintain its risk profile while reducing market risk RWA by $9.2 billion. The agent also developed a comprehensive trade compression program that eliminated redundant positions across desks, reducing operational complexity while simultaneously freeing up capital.

The Business Line ROE Analyst agent provided senior management with unprecedented clarity on the true capital consumption and returns of each business line, desk, and product. This led to several strategic pivots, including the expansion of certain electronic trading businesses with favorable capital profiles and the strategic reduction of capital-intensive structured products that were generating inadequate returns. The agent also designed new performance metrics and incentive structures for traders that incorporated capital efficiency, fundamentally changing how trading decisions were made throughout the organization.

One of the most valuable outcomes was the development of a real-time capital impact calculator that traders could use before executing trades. This tool, which leveraged the models developed by the agent system, transformed trader behavior by creating immediate awareness of how individual trading decisions affected the bank's overall capital position. Within six months, traders were proactively suggesting capital optimization strategies to their managers, creating a culture of capital awareness that had previously been lacking.

Following these impressive results, GlobalBank expanded the system to incorporate liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) optimization alongside traditional capital metrics. The board approved an expansion of certain trading businesses based on their demonstrated capital efficiency, and investors responded positively to the improved returns and more sophisticated approach to capital management. The bank's trading book ROE reached the 15% target after just 14 months, and competitors began developing similar systems after seeing GlobalBank's success in optimizing its regulatory capital profile.
