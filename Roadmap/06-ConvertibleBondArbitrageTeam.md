# Convertible Bond Arbitrage Team

## Overview
A multi-agent system designed for hedge funds executing convertible bond arbitrage strategies across multiple issuers. This system orchestrates specialized agents with expertise in equity analysis, credit research, volatility trading, and delta hedging to identify and execute profitable arbitrage opportunities within the convertible bond market.

## Business Value
- $2B convertible arbitrage portfolio targeting 12-15% net returns with 6% volatility
- Ability to screen 300+ convertible bonds across equity, credit, and volatility factors simultaneously
- Enhanced risk management during market stress scenarios
- Optimized hedging across multiple risk dimensions

## Personas

### Equity Analyst Agent
**Name:** Alex Morgan  
**Background:** 10+ years in equity research with focus on fundamental analysis and event-driven strategies  
**Company:** Parallax Capital Research  
**Responsibilities:**
Alex screens the convertible bond universe for mispricing opportunities, analyzing underlying equity valuations relative to embedded conversion options. She conducts detailed financial analysis of issuers, evaluates company fundamentals and growth prospects, and identifies potential catalysts that could drive equity price movements. Alex also monitors market sentiment and institutional positioning in the underlying equities.

### Credit Researcher Agent
**Name:** Daniel Chen  
**Background:** 12 years in corporate credit analysis and distressed debt investing  
**Company:** Meridian Credit Analytics  
**Responsibilities:**
Daniel assesses the default risk and credit quality of convertible bond issuers, analyzing balance sheet strength, cash flow generation, and debt service capabilities. He evaluates bond covenants and structural protections, monitors credit spread movements across sectors, and identifies early warning signs of credit deterioration or improvement. Daniel also analyzes the potential recovery values in distressed scenarios.

### Volatility Trader Agent
**Name:** Sofia Rodriguez  
**Background:** 8 years in derivatives trading with specialization in volatility products  
**Company:** Vega Strategies LLC  
**Responsibilities:**
Sofia models implied versus realized volatility for convertible securities, identifying discrepancies between market-implied and historical volatility patterns. She analyzes volatility skew and term structure for underlying equities, evaluates the volatility component of convertible valuations using Numerix Kynex analytics, and designs option overlay strategies to exploit volatility mispricing. Sofia also monitors market-wide volatility regimes and sector rotations.

### Delta Hedger Agent
**Name:** Michael Kim  
**Background:** 9 years in quantitative trading and systematic hedging strategies  
**Company:** Precision Risk Management  
**Responsibilities:**
Michael manages ongoing equity exposures through dynamic hedging strategies, calculating optimal hedge ratios for long convertible positions. He executes and rebalances hedges across changing market conditions, optimizes transaction costs and market impact of hedging activities, and manages Greeks exposures beyond delta (gamma, vega, theta). Michael also stress-tests hedging strategies under various market scenarios.

## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
Quantum Arbitrage Fund, a $2 billion multi-strategy hedge fund, identified convertible bond arbitrage as a key strategy to enhance risk-adjusted returns in their portfolio. The fund sought to capitalize on persistent inefficiencies in the convertible bond market, where these hybrid securities are often mispriced relative to their component parts (equity option, straight bond, and credit risk). Recent market volatility had created particularly attractive dislocations, but capturing these opportunities required sophisticated analysis across multiple dimensions simultaneously. The fund needed to evaluate hundreds of convertible bonds quickly, identify the most attractive arbitrage opportunities, and implement optimal hedging strategies to isolate specific risk premiums while maintaining strict risk parameters.

### Task
Develop an intelligent multi-agent system that can continuously screen the global convertible bond universe (300+ securities) to identify and rank arbitrage opportunities based on multiple factors: equity valuation, credit quality, implied volatility, and technical factors. The system must determine optimal position sizing and hedging strategies for each security, manage overall portfolio exposures, and adapt to changing market conditions in real-time. The portfolio must target 12-15% net returns with 6% volatility while maintaining resilience during stress scenarios such as equity market drawdowns, credit spread widening, and volatility regime shifts.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we established the core agent framework using Strands Agents SDK and integrated with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK with Kynex convertible analytics module
nx.initialize(
    license_key=os.environ.get("NUMERIX_LICENSE_KEY"),
    modules=["kynex", "crossasset", "portfolio_analytics"]
)

# Create agent network for the convertible arbitrage team
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Convertible Bond Arbitrage Team")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent was implemented with specialized capabilities using the Numerix SDK:

```python

### Result

By implementing the Convertible Bond Arbitrage Team system, Quantum Arbitrage Fund achieved outstanding results:

The fund's convertible arbitrage strategy generated a 14.2% net return in its first year of operation, with realized volatility of just 5.8%, exceeding the target risk-adjusted return profile. During a market correction where the S&P 500 declined by 12% over a two-month period, the convertible arbitrage portfolio demonstrated remarkable resilience, losing only 1.8% before quickly recovering. This performance validated the effectiveness of the system's hedging recommendations and risk management approach.

The multi-agent system's ability to simultaneously analyze equity fundamentals, credit metrics, and volatility patterns enabled the identification of several mispriced convertible securities that traditional single-factor approaches had overlooked. One particularly successful trade involved a technology company's convertible bond that was trading at a significant discount due to perceived credit concerns. The Credit Researcher Agent correctly identified that the market was overestimating default risk, while the Volatility Trader Agent recognized that the embedded equity option was significantly undervalued. This position alone contributed 1.8% to the fund's overall return.

The system's continuous monitoring and dynamic hedging recommendations allowed the fund to maintain consistent delta-neutrality despite significant market volatility. During the year, the average daily delta exposure was kept below 0.1% of NAV, effectively isolating the targeted risk factors. The system also identified optimal times to adjust hedges, saving an estimated 35 basis points in transaction costs compared to traditional fixed-schedule rebalancing approaches.

As word of the strategy's success spread, Quantum Arbitrage Fund attracted $500 million in additional investor capital earmarked specifically for the convertible arbitrage strategy, allowing them to scale the approach while maintaining performance. The Chief Investment Officer credited the multi-agent system's holistic approach and ability to process vast amounts of data simultaneously as key differentiators that provided the fund with a sustainable edge in the competitive arbitrage space.
