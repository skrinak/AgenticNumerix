## User Story: Barrier Option Structuring for Global Pharmaceutical Corporation

### Situation
JB Morgan's corporate banking team was approached by PharmaGlobal, a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company with significant business operations in Europe and emerging markets. PharmaGlobal's treasury department faced substantial FX exposure due to a €500 million research facility investment in Germany while their revenue remained predominantly USD-based. With EUR/USD volatility reaching five-year highs and the treasury team under pressure to manage costs, they needed a sophisticated hedging solution that would provide downside protection while optimizing upfront premium costs. Traditional vanilla options were deemed too expensive given their annual budget constraints.

### Task
The JB Morgan structured products team needed to design a tailored barrier option structure that would provide PharmaGlobal with EUR/USD downside protection while reducing upfront premium costs compared to vanilla options. The solution needed to balance protection, cost, accounting treatment, and risk governance requirements. The team had to price and analyze over 50 different barrier option variations to identify the optimal structure within a 48-hour timeframe to meet the client's urgent board presentation deadline.

### Action
The Exotic Options Structuring Syndicate was deployed as a multi-agent AI system leveraging both the Bedrock AgentCore SDK and Strands Agents framework for orchestration. Each specialist agent performed their role with continuous collaboration facilitated through the agent framework.

Emily (Product Structurer) initiated the process by analyzing the client's exposure profile and defining potential payoff structures. Using Python and the Numerix SDK, she modeled various knock-in and knock-out barrier options with different strikes, barriers, and maturities:

```python
from strands import Agent
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
from numerix import CrossAsset, BarrierOption, OptionType

# Product Structurer Agent Implementation
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

@app.entrypoint
def product_structurer_agent(request):
    # Extract client requirements from request
    client_data = request.get("client_data")
    exposure_amount = client_data["exposure_amount"]  # €500 million
    base_currency = client_data["base_currency"]      # USD
    foreign_currency = client_data["foreign_currency"] # EUR
    
    # Define potential barrier option structures
    barrier_structures = []
    
    # Down-and-in put options with varying parameters
    for strike_pct in [0.98, 0.97, 0.96, 0.95]:
        for barrier_pct in [0.94, 0.93, 0.92, 0.91, 0.90]:
            for maturity_months in [3, 6, 12, 18]:
                # Calculate actual strike and barrier levels based on spot
                spot = client_data["spot_rate"]  # Current EUR/USD rate
                strike = spot * strike_pct
                barrier = spot * barrier_pct
                
                # Create barrier option specification
                option = {
                    "type": "down_and_in_put",
                    "strike": strike,
                    "barrier": barrier,
                    "notional": exposure_amount,
                    "maturity_months": maturity_months,
                    "currency_pair": f"{foreign_currency}/{base_currency}"
                }
                
                barrier_structures.append(option)
    
    # Also consider knock-out options for premium reduction
    for strike_pct in [0.97, 0.96, 0.95]:
        for barrier_pct in [0.85, 0.84, 0.83]:
            for maturity_months in [6, 12]:
                spot = client_data["spot_rate"]
                strike = spot * strike_pct
                barrier = spot * barrier_pct
                
                option = {
                    "type": "down_and_out_put",
                    "strike": strike,
                    "barrier": barrier, 
                    "notional": exposure_amount,
                    "maturity_months": maturity_months,
                    "currency_pair": f"{foreign_currency}/{base_currency}"
                }
                
                barrier_structures.append(option)
    
    return {"barrier_structures": barrier_structures}
```

Marcus (Risk Analyst) received the proposed structures and performed comprehensive pricing and risk analysis using Numerix CrossAsset through the Strands Agent framework:

```python
from strands import Agent
from numerix import CrossAsset, BarrierOption, Greeks, ScenarioAnalysis

# Risk Analyst Agent Implementation
risk_analyst = Agent(
    name="RiskAnalyst",
    description="Prices and analyzes risk for exotic options structures"
)

@risk_analyst.tool("price_barrier_options")
def price_barrier_options(barrier_structures):
    pricing_results = []
    
    for option in barrier_structures:
        # Initialize Numerix CrossAsset pricing engine
        pricing_engine = CrossAsset.PricingEngine()
        
        # Create barrier option object based on type
        if option["type"] == "down_and_in_put":
            barrier_option = BarrierOption(
                option_type=OptionType.PUT,
                barrier_type="down_and_in",
                strike=option["strike"],
                barrier=option["barrier"],
                notional=option["notional"],
                maturity=option["maturity_months"] / 12.0,
                currency_pair=option["currency_pair"]
            )
        elif option["type"] == "down_and_out_put":
            barrier_option = BarrierOption(
                option_type=OptionType.PUT,
                barrier_type="down_and_out",
                strike=option["strike"],
                barrier=option["barrier"],
                notional=option["notional"],
                maturity=option["maturity_months"] / 12.0,
                currency_pair=option["currency_pair"]
            )
        
        # Price the option
        price = pricing_engine.price(barrier_option)
        
        # Calculate Greeks
        greeks = pricing_engine.calculate_greeks(barrier_option)
        
        # Run stress tests
        scenario_engine = ScenarioAnalysis()
        stress_results = scenario_engine.run_scenarios(
            option=barrier_option,
            spot_scenarios=[-0.5, -0.3, -0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5],  # ±10% to ±50%
            vol_scenarios=[-0.05, -0.025, 0, 0.025, 0.05],                    # ±5 vol points
            rate_scenarios=[-0.01, -0.005, 0, 0.005, 0.01]                    # ±100bp
        )
        
        # Calculate barrier breach probabilities
        breach_prob = pricing_engine.calculate_barrier_breach_probability(barrier_option)
        
        # Compile results
        result = {
            "option": option,
            "price": price,
            "greeks": greeks,
            "stress_results": stress_results,
            "barrier_breach_probability": breach_prob
        }
        
        pricing_results.append(result)
    
    return {"pricing_results": pricing_results}
```

Sophia (Market Data Specialist) validated all market data inputs to ensure accurate pricing:

```python
from strands import Agent
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
from numerix import MarketData, VolatilitySurface, CorrelationMatrix

# Market Data Specialist Agent Implementation
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

@app.entrypoint
def market_data_specialist_agent(request):
    # Extract option structures and pricing results
    pricing_results = request.get("pricing_results")
    
    # Initialize market data validation
    market_data = MarketData()
    validation_results = []
    
    for result in pricing_results:
        option = result["option"]
        
        # Validate volatility surface
        vol_surface = market_data.get_fx_volatility_surface(option["currency_pair"])
        vol_validation = vol_surface.validate(
            check_arbitrage=True,
            check_calendar_arbitrage=True,
            check_butterfly_arbitrage=True
        )
        
        # Compare against alternative data sources
        broker_quotes = market_data.get_broker_quotes(option["currency_pair"])
        vol_comparison = vol_surface.compare_to_quotes(broker_quotes)
        
        # Validate interest rate curves
        base_curve = market_data.get_yield_curve(option["currency_pair"].split('/')[1])
        foreign_curve = market_data.get_yield_curve(option["currency_pair"].split('/')[0])
        curve_validation = {
            "base_curve_valid": base_curve.validate(),
            "foreign_curve_valid": foreign_curve.validate()
        }
        
        # Check for market anomalies
        anomalies = market_data.detect_anomalies(option["currency_pair"])
        
        validation = {
            "option": option,
            "vol_surface_valid": vol_validation["is_valid"],
            "vol_surface_issues": vol_validation.get("issues", []),
            "curve_validation": curve_validation,

            "vol_comparison_with_brokers": vol_comparison
        }
        
        validation_results.append(validation)
    
    return {"validation_results": validation_results}
```

James (Client Advisor) optimized the final term sheet based on client preferences and feedback:

```python
from strands import Agent
from numerix import TermSheet, ClientPreferenceOptimizer

# Client Advisor Agent Implementation
client_advisor = Agent(
    name="ClientAdvisor",
    description="Optimizes option structures based on client preferences"
)

@client_advisor.tool("optimize_term_sheet")
def optimize_term_sheet(pricing_results, validation_results, client_preferences):
    # Initialize term sheet optimizer
    optimizer = ClientPreferenceOptimizer()
    
    # Filter out structures with invalid market data
    valid_structures = []
    for pr, vr in zip(pricing_results, validation_results):
        if vr["vol_surface_valid"] and vr["curve_validation"]["base_curve_valid"] and vr["curve_validation"]["foreign_curve_valid"]:
            valid_structures.append(pr)
    
    # Define optimization criteria based on client preferences
    criteria = {
        "max_premium": client_preferences["max_premium"],
        "min_protection": client_preferences["min_protection_level"],
        "max_complexity": client_preferences["max_complexity_score"],
        "accounting_treatment": client_preferences["accounting_treatment"],
        "min_maturity": client_preferences["min_maturity"],
        "max_maturity": client_preferences["max_maturity"]
    }
    
    # Find optimal structures
    optimal_structures = optimizer.find_optimal_structures(valid_structures, criteria)
    
    # Generate term sheets for top 3 recommendations
    term_sheets = []
    for i, structure in enumerate(optimal_structures[:3]):
        term_sheet = TermSheet.generate(
            structure["option"],
            structure["price"],
            structure["greeks"],
            client_name=client_preferences["client_name"],
            sales_contact=client_preferences["sales_contact"]
        )
        term_sheets.append(term_sheet)
    
    return {
        "optimal_structures": optimal_structures[:3],
        "term_sheets": term_sheets
    }
```

The orchestration of these agents was implemented using the Strands Agents framework, allowing them to collaborate efficiently:

```python
from strands import Agent, Orchestrator
from strands_tools import collaboration

# Create the multi-agent system
exotic_options_syndicate = Orchestrator(
    name="ExoticOptionsStructuringSyndicate",
    description="Multi-agent system for structuring exotic barrier options"
)

# Import the specialist agents
from agent_modules import product_structurer, risk_analyst, market_data_specialist, client_advisor

# Register the agents in the orchestrator
exotic_options_syndicate.add_agent(product_structurer)
exotic_options_syndicate.add_agent(risk_analyst)
exotic_options_syndicate.add_agent(market_data_specialist)
exotic_options_syndicate.add_agent(client_advisor)

# Define the workflow
@exotic_options_syndicate.workflow
def structure_exotic_option(client_data):
    # Step 1: Product Structurer proposes option structures
    proposed_structures = product_structurer.propose_barrier_structures(client_data)
    
    # Step 2: Risk Analyst prices and evaluates the structures
    pricing_results = risk_analyst.price_barrier_options(proposed_structures)
    
    # Step 3: Market Data Specialist validates market data inputs
    validation_results = market_data_specialist.validate_market_data(pricing_results)
    
    # Step 4: Client Advisor optimizes the term sheet
    client_preferences = client_data.get("preferences", {})
    final_recommendations = client_advisor.optimize_term_sheet(
        pricing_results, 
        validation_results,
        client_preferences
    )
    
    return final_recommendations

# Deploy to AWS Lambda with Bedrock AgentCore integration
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp

app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

@app.entrypoint
def handle_structuring_request(request):
    client_data = request.get("client_data")
    return exotic_options_syndicate.structure_exotic_option(client_data)

# Configure for parallel processing on AWS
app.config.concurrency = 8  # Process multiple option pricing in parallel
app.config.memory = "16GB"  # Ensure sufficient memory for numerical calculations

# Run the application on Bedrock AgentCore
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

With this implementation, the system could process 50+ barrier option variations simultaneously, leveraging AWS Lambda's parallel processing capabilities and the Bedrock AgentCore infrastructure. The Strands Agent framework facilitated seamless collaboration between specialist agents, each performing their specific roles in the exotic options structuring process.

### Result
The Exotic Options Structuring Syndicate delivered a comprehensive analysis of 58 different barrier option structures within 24 hours, half the requested timeframe. The optimal solution was a 12-month EUR/USD down-and-in put with a 0.96 strike and 0.92 barrier level, providing PharmaGlobal with complete protection below the barrier while reducing the premium by 38% compared to a vanilla put option with the same strike. The structure included a detailed risk analysis showing potential valuations across various market scenarios.

PharmaGlobal's treasury team presented the proposed structure to their board with confidence, supported by clear analytics on cost savings, protection levels, and stress test results. The board approved the €500 million hedge, and JB Morgan executed the transaction at a 22 basis point revenue margin, above their typical 15-20bp target. Furthermore, the success of this structured solution led to PharmaGlobal engaging JB Morgan for additional hedging needs across their global operations, resulting in a 30% increase in treasury business from this client over the next 12 months.

The Exotic Options Structuring Syndicate has since been deployed for numerous other corporate clients, generating over $15 million in additional structured products revenue by enabling rapid customization of complex barrier option strategies while maintaining rigorous risk management standards. The system's ability to simultaneously evaluate multiple option structures while ensuring market data integrity has reduced the time-to-market for complex structures from 3-4 days to less than 24 hours, providing a significant competitive advantage in time-sensitive client situations.
