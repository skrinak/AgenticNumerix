## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
EuroLife Insurance, a mid-sized European life insurer with â‚¬45 billion in assets and a significant portfolio of variable annuities and investment guarantees, faced mounting pressure on its Solvency II position. Following the latest market volatility and regulatory stress tests, the company's Solvency II ratio had declined from 165% to 138%, uncomfortably close to both its internal risk appetite threshold of 130% and the heightened supervisory scrutiny level of 120%. The deterioration was driven by several factors: a substantial increase in the SCR for their growing variable annuity portfolio, unexpected policyholder behavior in low interest rate environments that exacerbated guarantee costs, and suboptimal asset-liability matching that consumed excess capital under market stress scenarios. The company's existing approach to capital modeling relied on simplified standard formula calculations with conservative approximations for complex guarantees, leading to potentially excessive capital requirements. Simultaneously, EuroLife was exploring new product innovations and investment strategies but lacked the analytical capabilities to assess their capital implications before implementation. Senior management faced difficult decisions about product strategy, investment approach, hedging program design, and potential capital raising, all in a competitive market where capital efficiency had become a key differentiator. The Board had mandated a comprehensive review of the company's Solvency II position with specific focus on identifying opportunities to optimize capital consumption while maintaining appropriate protection for policyholders and meeting all regulatory requirements.

### Task
Develop a sophisticated Solvency II Solvency Capital Requirement Laboratory capable of calculating SCR across 300+ insurance-specific scenarios tailored to EuroLife's portfolio characteristics. The system needed to model the complex interactions between market risks, insurance risks, and policyholder behavior, particularly for variable annuities with complex guarantee structures. It had to identify optimization opportunities across asset allocation, liability management, and hedging strategies to improve the Solvency II position by at least 20 percentage points without requiring additional capital. The solution needed to incorporate both standard formula and internal model approaches to quantify potential benefits of model sophistication, provide comprehensive documentation to support regulatory engagement, and enable rapid evaluation of new product designs and investment strategies. Additionally, it had to support the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) process by evaluating solvency positions under forward-looking scenarios and stress tests. The goal was to create a sustainable framework for capital-efficient decision making across product development, investment strategy, hedging program design, and reinsurance utilization, ultimately enabling EuroLife to maintain a competitive position in the market while ensuring robust financial protection for policyholders.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we established the core agent framework by integrating Strands Agents SDK with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx
import os
import json

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK with Solvency II and insurance risk modules
nx.initialize(
    license_key=os.environ.get("NUMERIX_LICENSE_KEY"),
    modules=["solvency_ii", "insurance_risk", "variable_annuity", "alm_analytics"]
)

# Create agent network for the Solvency II SCR Laboratory
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Solvency II SCR Laboratory")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent was implemented with specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

### Result

The implementation of the Solvency II SCR Laboratory transformed EuroLife Insurance's approach to capital management, delivering both immediate tactical benefits and long-term strategic advantages. Within the first quarter of deployment, the system identified and executed opportunities that improved the company's Solvency II ratio from 138% to 152%, without requiring additional capital. This improvement provided immediate relief from regulatory pressure and created headroom for strategic business initiatives.

The Actuarial Risk Modeling Specialist agent delivered transformative insights into the company's variable annuity portfolio. By implementing more sophisticated stochastic modeling techniques, the agent identified that EuroLife had been significantly overestimating the capital requirements for certain guarantee types under the standard formula. The agent's granular policyholder behavior models revealed that actual policyholder utilization of guarantees was meaningfully different from industry standard assumptions, particularly in low interest rate environments. By calibrating models to EuroLife's actual experience, the company was able to reduce insurance risk SCR by â‚¬165 million while maintaining appropriate prudence in reserving. The agent also designed a more refined approach to contract boundaries that better aligned with regulatory expectations while reducing technical provisions by â‚¬82 million.

The ALM Strategy Architect agent discovered significant inefficiencies in EuroLife's asset allocation strategy. By analyzing duration, convexity, and key rate duration mismatches across the portfolio, the agent identified specific liability segments where asset-liability matching could be substantially improved. The implementation of liability-driven investment strategies for these segments reduced interest rate risk SCR by â‚¬143 million. Additionally, the agent designed a matching adjustment portfolio for eligible liabilities that met all Solvency II eligibility criteria, resulting in a more favorable discount rate for these liabilities and improving the Solvency II balance sheet by â‚¬95 million. The agent's portfolio optimization also identified opportunities to reduce spread risk SCR by reallocating certain fixed income holdings without sacrificing yield, delivering a further â‚¬78 million reduction in capital requirements.

The Variable Annuity Hedging Strategist agent revolutionized EuroLife's approach to hedging its guarantee portfolio. Through detailed exposure analysis, the agent identified that the existing hedging program was inefficiently focused on hedging equity delta risk while underhedging interest rate and volatility exposures that were actually driving more SCR. By redesigning the hedging program to focus on risk-weighted exposures rather than nominal exposures, the agent created a more capital-efficient approach that improved hedge effectiveness from 67% to 83% while actually reducing hedging costs by 12%. The agent also designed a dynamic hedging strategy with trigger-based rebalancing that reduced operational complexity while maintaining effectiveness. These improvements reduced market risk SCR for the variable annuity portfolio by â‚¬112 million and significantly reduced the volatility of the Solvency II ratio.

The Solvency II Compliance Expert agent provided critical insights into regulatory treatment of risk mitigation techniques and how to properly document them for supervisory approval. The agent designed comprehensive documentation packages that clearly demonstrated the risk transfer achieved through the new hedging strategies, ensuring full credit was received in SCR calculations. Additionally, the agent developed an enhanced ORSA process that incorporated forward-looking scenarios specifically tailored to EuroLife's risk profile, providing senior management with unprecedented clarity on potential future capital requirements under different business strategies. The agent's regulatory engagement strategy helped EuroLife successfully negotiate with supervisors regarding several model improvements, resulting in approval for partial internal model components that further improved capital efficiency.

Beyond the immediate capital benefits, the system's comprehensive scenario analysis capabilities enabled EuroLife to evaluate new product innovations with confidence. The company successfully launched a redesigned variable annuity product with more capital-efficient guarantee structures, achieving both customer appeal and capital efficiency. The executive dashboard created by the system became a central tool for strategic decision making, with the Board and senior management regularly using scenario analyses to evaluate new initiatives.

The overall success of the implementation prompted EuroLife to expand the system's scope to include IFRS 17 implications, creating a unified framework for managing both regulatory capital and accounting impacts. Within 18 months of implementation, the company's Solvency II ratio had improved to 172%, well above both internal targets and peer averages, positioning the company for sustainable growth and market leadership.
