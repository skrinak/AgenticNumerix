## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
Alpine Private Bank, a mid-sized wealth management institution serving high-net-worth clients across Europe and Asia, faced increasing pressure to innovate their structured product offerings. Their traditional range of capital-protected notes and simple autocallables was losing appeal as historically low interest rates compressed returns and sophisticated clients sought more innovative solutions. The bank's annual structured product issuance had plateaued at $1.3 billion, with declining margins as they competed primarily on pricing rather than product differentiation. Market research indicated that clients were increasingly allocating to competitors' structured products that offered more tailored payoff profiles and thematic investment exposures. The bank's existing product development process was siloed and slow, taking 8-12 weeks to bring new structures to market—by which time market conditions had often changed, rendering initial pricing assumptions obsolete. Their manual stress testing process covered only a limited range of scenarios, creating potential blind spots in risk assessment. Additionally, recent regulatory changes had increased documentation and suitability requirements, adding compliance complexity to new product introductions.

### Task
Develop an integrated, AI-driven structured products laboratory that could accelerate innovation while enhancing risk management and compliance. The system needed to test at least 75 autocallable variations with different barriers, coupons, and underlyings simultaneously, stress-testing each structure against diverse market scenarios including severe crashes (-20% to -50%), volatility regime changes (10-40 vol), autocall trigger scenarios, and varying correlation assumptions for worst-of baskets (0.3-0.9). The goal was to grow the bank's structured product issuance to $2 billion annually while targeting 300 basis point profit margins and ensuring less than 5% capital was at risk even in extreme market scenarios. The system needed to enable rapid prototyping of new structures, comprehensive risk analysis, targeted distribution strategies, and bulletproof compliance documentation—all while reducing time-to-market to under 4 weeks.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we established the core agent framework using Strands Agents SDK and integrated with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx
import os

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK with structured products modules
nx.initialize(
    license_key=os.environ.get("NUMERIX_LICENSE_KEY"),
    modules=["structured_products", "monte_carlo", "risk_analytics", "market_data"]
)

# Create agent network for the Structured Products Innovation Lab
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Structured Products Innovation Lab")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent was implemented with specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

### Result

Alpine Private Bank implemented the Structured Products Innovation Lab and revolutionized their approach to product development. Within six months of deployment, the bank had created 12 innovative structured product series with differentiated payoff profiles tailored to specific client segments. The AI-driven system enabled rapid iteration and comprehensive risk assessment, with each new product concept moving from initial design to launch in just 3-4 weeks compared to the previous 8-12 week timeline.

The Quant Researcher agent Dr. Chen designed several breakthrough structures, including a "climate transition" autocallable linked to a basket of companies with ambitious emissions reduction targets, which featured an innovative downside buffer mechanism that provided partial protection even if the worst-performing stock breached the barrier level. The Market Strategist agent Thomas validated this structure's correlation assumptions and identified a market opportunity in the relative valuation of climate-focused companies, leading to advantageous entry points for product issuance.

The Risk Manager agent Priya conducted extensive stress testing across 320 scenarios, identifying specific correlation regimes where the climate transition basket exhibited heightened gap risk. She developed a tailored hedging strategy that used sector ETF options to manage the correlation risk cost-effectively while maintaining tight Greeks limits. The capital impact analysis showed these products consumed 20% less regulatory capital than the bank's traditional structures due to their optimized risk profile.

The Distribution Specialist agent Miguel created targeted segmentation that identified three distinct client archetypes ideally suited for different variants of the climate transition product. For sophisticated wealth management clients, a more complex worst-of structure offered enhanced returns, while private banking clients were offered a slightly more conservative variant with additional downside protection. The agent created differentiated educational materials for each segment, resulting in a 45% increase in advisor confidence when discussing these products with clients.

The Compliance Officer agent Elizabeth ensured all products met the stringent requirements of MiFID II and other relevant regulations across Alpine's operating jurisdictions. She designed a streamlined product governance process that automatically generated required documentation and identified potential conflicts of interest before they became issues. The comprehensive audit trail provided by the system ensured complete regulatory transparency and significantly reduced compliance overhead.

By year-end, Alpine Private Bank had exceeded their $2 billion issuance target while maintaining an average profit margin of 310 basis points—higher than their 300 basis point goal. Client satisfaction scores for structured products increased by 18 percentage points, and the bank's reputation for innovation attracted over $400 million in new assets under management from clients seeking sophisticated investment solutions. The maximum capital at risk in stress scenarios was maintained below 4%, exceeding the risk management target of 5%.

Beyond the quantitative results, the Structured Products Innovation Lab fundamentally transformed the bank's approach to product development. The collaborative agent framework broke down silos between different functional areas, creating a seamless workflow from quantitative design to client delivery. The system's ability to rapidly prototype and test new structures encouraged a culture of innovation, with relationship managers actively contributing product ideas based on client conversations. Alpine Private Bank has now positioned itself as a structured products leader in its markets, with competitors struggling to match both the innovation speed and product quality enabled by their AI-powered innovation laboratory.
