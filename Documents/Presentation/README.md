## Demo Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- AWS account with SageMaker access
- Jupyter notebook from Documents directory (`multi_asset_hedging_sagemaker.ipynb`)
- Sample data or synthetic data generator
- Bedrock access (for Claude integration)

### Demo Checklist
```bash
# 1. Start SageMaker notebook instance
aws sagemaker start-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name numerix-demo

# 2. Wait for instance to be InService
aws sagemaker describe-notebook-instance --notebook-instance-name numerix-demo

# 3. Open Jupyter Lab
# Navigate to: https://[instance-url]/lab

# 4. Load the notebook
# Open: multi_asset_hedging_sagemaker.ipynb

# 5. Run setup cells (don't show this in demo)
# Execute cells 1-5 before demo starts

# 6. Demo starts at Cell 6 (Strategy Configuration)
```

### Demo Script
```
"Let me show you how this works in practice. I'm going to optimize
a dynamic allocation strategy for a $10 billion portfolio.

[Click Cell 6]
Here we define the strategy hyperparameters - target volatility,
equity weight functions, lookback windows. The AI will explore
all combinations.

[Click Cell 8]
Now I'm launching the optimization across 5 market scenarios -
bull market, bear market, high volatility, low volatility, and base case.

[Click Run]
Watch this progress bar - we're testing 100 strategies per scenario,
500 total evaluations. On traditional Excel this would take weeks.
AI will complete this in... [check time] ...about 12 minutes.

[While running, show other cells]
While that runs, let me show you what the output looks like...

[Click to Results]
Here's the convergence chart - you can see the Sharpe ratio improving
as the AI finds better strategies. Started at 1.2, found 1.5.

[Click to Dashboard]
And here's our 'pretty charts' dashboard - risk-return scatter,
hyperparameter sensitivity, best strategy summary.

[Click to Claude Summary]
Finally, Claude analyzes all results and generates recommendations
in natural language. Notice it explains WHY this strategy is robust -
performs well in both bull and bear markets.

Questions on the demo?"
