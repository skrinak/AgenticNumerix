## Q&A Session (15 minutes)

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: How is this different from traditional portfolio optimization software?**

A: Traditional software optimizes within pre-defined parameter spaces. Agentic AI autonomously explores the full hyperparameter space, discovering non-intuitive configurations that humans never test. It's the difference between answering questions you already have vs. discovering questions you should be asking.

---

**Q: What if the AI recommends a strategy that performs poorly in live markets?**

A: Multi-layered risk management:
1. Extensive backtesting across 5 market regimes
2. Out-of-sample validation on historical crises
3. Human-in-the-loop approval gates
4. Continuous monitoring and automatic alerts
5. Numerix regulatory-grade analytics ensure institutional rigor

The AI doesn't execute trades—it recommends strategies that portfolio managers validate and approve.

---

**Q: How do we explain AI recommendations to the investment committee?**

A: Claude generates natural language explanations:
- "This strategy uses inverse volatility squared weighting because historical data shows it maintains performance during regime transitions"
- "Target volatility of 12% optimal based on current yield curve steepness and equity risk premium"
- Full audit trail showing which scenarios drove the recommendation

---

**Q: What's our vendor lock-in risk with AWS/Bedrock?**

A: Architecture is cloud-agnostic:
- Numerix SDK runs in containers (portable to any cloud)
- Agents use standard OpenAPI interfaces
- Data stored in S3-compatible formats
- Infrastructure as code (Terraform) enables multi-cloud deployment

Migration to Azure/GCP would take weeks, not months.

---

**Q: How long before we see results?**

A:
- **Week 1**: Data integration, notebook setup
- **Week 4**: First optimization runs with real data
- **Week 8**: Portfolio managers trained, running daily
- **Week 12**: Measurable Sharpe ratio improvement

Payback on investment: 2-3 weeks based on operational efficiency alone.

---

**Q: What happens if we don't do this?**

A: Competitors are already exploring AI for portfolio management:
- BlackRock has AI-enhanced Aladdin
- Two Sigma built quant strategies on ML
- Renaissance Technologies pioneered algorithmic approaches

Inaction creates 3 risks:
1. **Performance gap**: Competitors achieve 50+ bps alpha advantage
2. **Talent drain**: Top quants leave for AI-forward firms
3. **Client migration**: RFPs increasingly require AI capabilities

---

**Q: Can we start smaller than $500K?**

A: Yes, phased approach:
- **$100K proof-of-concept**: Jupyter notebook on 1 portfolio, synthetic data
- **$250K limited pilot**: 3 portfolio managers, Refinitiv integration
- **$500K full pilot**: 10 portfolio managers, production AWS deployment

However, smaller scope = longer payback. $500K investment pays back in 2-3 weeks with full deployment.

---

**Q: How do we ensure data security and regulatory compliance?**

A: Enterprise-grade security:
- Encryption at rest (AWS KMS) and in transit (TLS)
- Role-based access control (Cognito + IAM)
- Audit logging (CloudTrail, CloudWatch)
- Compliance frameworks: SOC 2, ISO 27001
- Data residency controls (US-only regions)
- Annual penetration testing
- Numerix is already approved vendor for regulatory analytics

---

**Q: What's the ongoing maintenance burden?**

A: Minimal operational overhead:
- Serverless architecture (no servers to manage)
- Auto-scaling infrastructure (no capacity planning)
- Managed services (AWS handles patching, updates)
- 1 engineer at 25% time (~$50K annually)

This is intentionally designed as low-maintenance infrastructure.

---

**Q: How does this integrate with our existing portfolio management system?**

A: API-first design:
- REST endpoints for strategy submission
- WebSocket for real-time status updates
- Standard JSON format for results
- Export to Excel/PDF for investment committee

Integration pattern:
1. Portfolio manager reviews holdings in existing system
2. Submits optimization request via web interface
3. Reviews AI recommendations
4. Exports strategy to portfolio management system for execution
