# Dynamic Asset Allocation with Agentic AI
## Executive Summary

---

## The Challenge

**Traditional portfolio construction is fundamentally constrained:**

- Portfolio managers manually test 5-10 strategy configurations
- Limited scenario analysis due to computational constraints
- Point-in-time optimization vulnerable to market regime changes
- Weeks of analyst time required for comprehensive strategy evaluation

**Result**: Portfolios operate with suboptimal allocation rules, leaving alpha generation on the table.

---

## The Solution

**Agentic AI + Numerix Analytics + AWS Cloud Infrastructure**

Transform strategy development from manual hypothesis testing to **systematic parameter space exploration at cloud scale**.

### How It Works

1. **AI agents explore 100+ strategy configurations** across multiple market regimes
2. **Numerix SDK provides institutional-grade pricing and risk analytics**
3. **AWS infrastructure parallelizes computation** (minutes vs. weeks)
4. **Claude analyzes results** and generates actionable recommendations

## Real-World Use Case

**Dynamic Volatility-Targeted Asset Allocation**

- **Assets**: Equity index + Fixed income portfolio
- **Strategy**: Allocation adjusts based on rolling realized volatility
- **Innovation**: AI discovers optimal allocation rules humans never test

### Hyperparameter Space Explored

- Target volatility levels (5-20%)
- Equity weight functions (4 different approaches)
- Volatility estimation windows (configurable)
- Risk aversion parameters
- Transaction cost optimization

### Market Scenarios Tested

- Base case (normal conditions)
- Bull market (risk-on environment)
- Bear market (crisis conditions)
- High volatility regime
- Low volatility regime

**Critical Insight**: Optimal parameters differ across regimes. AI identifies robust strategies that maintain performance across all conditions.

## Conclusion

**Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in quantitative portfolio management.**

Traditional approaches relied on human intuition to narrow the strategy search space. Agentic AI inverts this: comprehensive search discovers optimal strategies, and human expertise focuses on governance, interpretation, and strategic oversight.

**For institutions evaluating Bedrock adoption**, this use case provides concrete evidence that generative AI delivers measurable financial value in quantitative domains.

**The transformation is not incremental—it is fundamental.**

The methodology is proven, the technology is production-ready, and the business case is compelling.

**The question is not whether to adopt agentic AI for portfolio management—it is how quickly institutions can deploy these capabilities before competitive disadvantage becomes insurmountable.**
