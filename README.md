# AgenticNumerix: AI-Powered Financial Risk Analytics

> **Transforming financial analytics through intelligent agent orchestration with the Numerix SDK**

![Agentic AI Architecture](Documents/agentic_architecture_highlevel.png)

**Workflow:** Portfolio managers submit optimization requests through a React frontend, triggering a sophisticated multi-agent orchestration system powered by Strands Agents. Specialized AI agents (Portfolio Risk Manager, FX Specialist, Interest Rate Strategist, Credit Analyst) collaborate through AWS Bedrock AgentCore, leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet for intelligent decision-making. These agents invoke custom action groups that call Numerix SDK analytics (CrossAsset pricing, Economic Scenario Generator, XVA calculations) to evaluate strategies across thousands of market scenarios. SageMaker distributes the computational workload across multiple instances, processing results in parallel, while S3 and DynamoDB persist data and agent state. The entire workflow‚Äîfrom strategy submission to comprehensive analysis with visualizations‚Äîcompletes in minutes rather than the weeks required for manual analysis, enabling portfolio managers to discover optimal allocation strategies that maintain robustness across varying market conditions.
