## Personas

### Market Risk Monitor Agent
**Name:** Sarah Chen  
**Background:** 12+ years in market risk management at global investment banks  
**Company:** RiskMetrics Solutions  
**Responsibilities:**
Sarah oversees real-time monitoring of market risk exposures across all trading desks and asset classes. She continuously analyzes VaR utilization and risk factor sensitivities, detecting potential limit breaches before they occur. Sarah evaluates market stress scenarios and their potential impacts on portfolios, implements early warning indicators for emerging risks, and provides timely alerts on changing market conditions that could affect risk positions.

### Credit Risk Assessor Agent
**Name:** Michael Torres  
**Background:** 10 years in counterparty credit risk and CVA management  
**Company:** Credit Analytics Partners  
**Responsibilities:**
Michael evaluates counterparty exposures and potential default risks across the trading book. He calculates and monitors credit valuation adjustments (CVA) and potential future exposures (PFE), analyzes credit concentration risks by sector, geography, and counterparty. Michael also assesses credit migration impacts on capital requirements and evaluates wrong-way risk in derivatives portfolios. His analysis feeds into both the market risk assessment and regulatory capital calculations.

### Liquidity Manager Agent
**Name:** Priya Singh  
**Background:** 11 years in liquidity risk management and treasury operations  
**Company:** Global Liquidity Advisors  
**Responsibilities:**
Priya monitors trading book liquidity across normal and stressed market conditions. She evaluates position liquidation horizons and potential fire sale impacts, tracks daily liquidity coverage and funding requirements, and analyzes collateral availability and quality across trading operations. Priya ensures that liquidity constraints are properly factored into risk limits and hedging decisions, particularly during market stress scenarios or when large positions need to be adjusted quickly.

### Regulatory Reporter Agent
**Name:** Jonathan Maxwell  
**Background:** 9 years in financial regulatory compliance and risk reporting  
**Company:** Regulatory Intelligence Group  
**Responsibilities:**
Jonathan ensures that all risk measurements comply with regulatory standards including Basel III/IV, FRTB, and local regulatory requirements. He prepares timely and accurate regulatory reports on risk exposures and capital utilization, monitors changes in regulatory requirements that may impact risk methodologies, and ensures data quality and auditability of all risk calculations. Jonathan also coordinates responses to regulatory inquiries regarding risk management practices.

### Escalation Coordinator Agent
**Name:** Diana Washington  
**Background:** 15 years in risk governance and crisis management  
**Company:** Risk Governance Associates  
**Responsibilities:**
Diana manages the escalation process when risk limits are breached or anomalies are detected. She coordinates communications between risk teams, trading desks, and senior management, implements predefined escalation protocols based on breach severity, and ensures appropriate remediation actions are taken within required timeframes. Diana also facilitates post-breach analysis to improve future risk controls and documents all risk events and responses for governance purposes.

## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
Global Investment Partners (GIP), a tier-one investment bank with a $100 billion trading book spanning 50+ desks across equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities, and structured products, faced increasing challenges in managing their complex risk landscape. Traditional end-of-day risk reporting was proving inadequate in volatile markets where risk profiles could change dramatically within hours. Recent flash crashes had exposed weaknesses in their risk monitoring systems, with several desks briefly exceeding their VaR limits without timely detection. Regulatory pressures were intensifying, with new FRTB (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book) requirements demanding more granular and frequent risk assessments. Senior management needed a comprehensive, real-time view of the firm's risk exposures to make informed decisions and optimize capital allocation while ensuring regulatory compliance.

### Task
Develop an intelligent real-time risk surveillance network capable of monitoring 10,000+ positions across all trading desks with sub-second updates. The system needed to simultaneously track market risk (VaR, sensitivities), credit risk (counterparty exposures), and liquidity risk, while providing early warning of potential limit breaches. It had to generate automated hedging recommendations when risks approached thresholds, produce regulatory-compliant reports, and manage escalation workflows when breaches occurred. The solution needed to withstand extreme market scenarios including major market shocks (Â±3 standard deviation moves), liquidity crises (50% market depth reduction), credit events (both single-name and sector-wide), and operational disruptions, all while maintaining accurate risk assessments and actionable insights.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we established the core agent framework using Strands Agents SDK and integrated with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK with risk analytics modules
nx.initialize(
    license_key=os.environ.get("NUMERIX_LICENSE_KEY"),
    modules=["var_analytics", "crossasset", "counterparty_risk", "liquidity_risk", "regulatory_capital"]
)

# Create agent network for the risk surveillance team
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Real-Time Risk Surveillance Network")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent was implemented with specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

```python

#### 4. Real-Time Processing with AWS Lambda and Kinesis

To achieve sub-second risk updates across 10,000+ positions, we implemented a streaming architecture:

```python
# AWS Lambda handler for real-time position updates
def position_update_handler(event, context):

#### 6. High-Performance Computing Architecture

The Real-Time Risk Surveillance Network leveraged AWS's most powerful compute resources for sub-second risk analysis:

```python
# High-performance VaR calculation implementation
def calculate_high_performance_var(positions, market_data, parameters):
    # Determine optimal parallel processing approach
    total_positions = len(positions)
    
    if total_positions < 1000:
        # Use in-memory processing
        return nx.var_analytics.calculate_var_direct(
            positions=positions,
            market_data=market_data,
            parameters=parameters
        )
    else:
        # Partition positions for distributed processing
        position_batches = partition_positions(
            positions=positions,
            partition_strategy="risk_balanced",
            num_partitions=50  # One per desk
        )
        
        # Submit distributed calculation tasks
        task_ids = []
        for batch in position_batches:
            task_id = submit_distributed_task(
                task_type="var_calculation",
                positions=batch,
                market_data=market_data,
                parameters=parameters
            )
            task_ids.append(task_id)
        
        # Wait for all tasks to complete (with timeout)
        results = wait_for_distributed_tasks(
            task_ids=task_ids,
            timeout_seconds=2  # Ensure sub-second response
        )
        
        # Aggregate results
        return aggregate_var_results(results)
```

### Result

Global Investment Partners implemented the Real-Time Risk Surveillance Network and achieved transformative results across their risk management operations. The system successfully monitored over 10,000 trading positions across 50+ desks with sub-second risk updates, providing traders and risk managers with immediate visibility into their exposures and limit utilization. During a period of extreme market volatility following an unexpected central bank policy shift, the system detected emerging risk concentrations across multiple fixed income desks and automatically recommended optimal hedging strategies, preventing potential VaR limit breaches that would have otherwise gone undetected until end-of-day processing.

The bank realized a capital efficiency improvement of 190 basis points by optimizing their risk allocation across trading activities, representing annual savings of approximately $190 million on their $100 billion trading book. This efficiency was achieved through more accurate risk measurement and timely mitigation of concentrations. Regulators specifically commended the bank's enhanced risk monitoring capabilities during their annual review, noting that GIP's real-time risk surveillance represented a best-in-class implementation that exceeded minimum regulatory requirements.

The system's escalation capabilities were put to the test during a major credit event affecting a significant counterparty. The Credit Risk Assessor agent identified concerning exposure patterns hours before the market broadly recognized the deteriorating credit situation. The Escalation Coordinator agent immediately triggered the appropriate protocol, mobilizing the credit trading team to reduce exposures and implement hedges before market prices moved significantly. This early action saved the bank an estimated $25 million in potential losses.

Perhaps most importantly, the Real-Time Risk Surveillance Network transformed the risk culture at Global Investment Partners. Trading desks gained deeper insights into how their activities affected the bank's overall risk profile, and risk managers could focus on strategic analysis rather than manual data collection and report generation. The bank's CRO reported that board-level risk discussions became more forward-looking and strategic, with less time spent reviewing historical exposures. The system's success led GIP to expand its application beyond trading to include enterprise-wide risk surveillance across lending, operational, and strategic risk dimensions.
