## Situation

Quantum Alpha Capital, a $5 billion systematic hedge fund, faced increasing challenges as traditional factor investing approaches began to show signs of crowding. Returns from conventional strategies had compressed significantly over the past 24 months, with correlation across supposedly diverse strategies increasing during market stress periods. The investment committee recognized the need to evolve their approach by developing a more sophisticated multi-factor strategy that could harvest alternative risk premia across asset classes while maintaining resilience during regime shifts. The fund's CIO established the Alternative Risk Premia Harvesting Collective, bringing together specialists across volatility, carry, mean reversion, momentum, and risk allocation domains to create an integrated approach to systematic investing.

## Task

The Alternative Risk Premia Harvesting Collective was tasked with designing and implementing a cloud-native multi-strategy investment system capable of identifying, evaluating, and capturing risk premia across global markets. Their specific objectives included: developing agent-based models for each specialized risk premium domain; creating a collaborative framework for cross-strategy insights; implementing Numerix analytics for cross-asset risk modeling; building an allocation system that could dynamically adjust to changing market conditions; deploying the entire system on AWS cloud infrastructure for scalable signal processing; and achieving target returns of 15% with volatility of 12% through diversified risk premia capture.

## Action

The team began by developing specialized agents for each risk premium domain, leveraging the Strands Agents framework for orchestration while implementing Numerix analytics for cross-asset risk modeling. Emma Chen, the Volatility Harvester, created an agent that analyzed volatility surface dynamics across equity indices, single stocks, and commodities.

```python
from strands import Agent
from strands.tools import numerix_tools

import numpy as np

# Create the Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

def volatility_harvester_agent(request):
    agent = Agent(
        name="Volatility Harvester",
        tools=[
            numerix_tools.implied_volatility_surface,
            numerix_tools.variance_swap_pricing,
            numerix_tools.vol_term_structure
        ]
    )
    
    # Extract market data from request
    market_data = request.get("market_data")
    
    # Analyze volatility surface for mispricing
    vol_surface_analysis = agent(
        f"Analyze the volatility surface for {market_data['ticker']} to identify term structure anomalies and skew distortions."
    )
    
    # Calculate variance risk premium
    variance_risk_premium = numerix_tools.variance_swap_pricing.calculate_variance_risk_premium(
        ticker=market_data['ticker'],
        expiry_range=[30, 60, 90, 180],
        historical_window=252
    )
    
    # Generate volatility harvesting signals
    signals = []
    for expiry in variance_risk_premium:
        if variance_risk_premium[expiry]['vrp'] > 2.0:  # VRP threshold
            signals.append({
                'strategy': 'Volatility Selling',
                'instrument': f"{market_data['ticker']} {expiry}-day variance swap",
                'signal': variance_risk_premium[expiry]['vrp'],
                'confidence': variance_risk_premium[expiry]['signal_quality']
            })
    
    return {
        'agent': 'Volatility Harvester',
        'signals': signals,
        'analysis': vol_surface_analysis

                carry_to_risk = rate_differential / tail_risk if tail_risk > 0 else 0
                
                if carry_to_risk > 0.5:  # Threshold for attractive carry
                    carry_opportunities.append({
                        'pair': f"{base}/{quote}",
                        'carry': rate_differential,

                        'forward_curve': forward_points
                    })
    
    # Sort opportunities by carry-to-risk ratio
    carry_opportunities.sort(key=lambda x: x['carry_to_risk'], reverse=True)
    
    return {
        'agent': 'Carry Strategist',
        'opportunities': carry_opportunities[:10]  # Top 10 opportunities
    }
```

The team integrated their specialized agents using the Strands Agents framework to enable seamless collaboration:

```python
from strands import AgentNetwork

Olivia Bennett, as Risk Budgeter, developed a sophisticated portfolio optimization system using Numerix's risk analytics:

```python
# Risk Budgeter Agent implementation
@app.entrypoint
def risk_budgeter_agent(request):
    agent = Agent(
        name="Risk Budgeter",
        tools=[
            numerix_tools.portfolio_optimization,
            numerix_tools.risk_decomposition,
            numerix_tools.correlation_analysis,
            numerix_tools.monte_carlo_simulation
        ]
    )
    
    # Extract strategy signals from request
    strategy_signals = request.get("strategy_signals")
    
    # Group signals by strategy type
    strategy_groups = {
        'volatility': [s for s in strategy_signals if s.get('strategy', '').lower().startswith('volatility')],
        'carry': [s for s in strategy_signals if s.get('pair', '')],
        'mean_reversion': [s for s in strategy_signals if s.get('mean_reversion_score', 0) > 0],
        'momentum': [s for s in strategy_signals if s.get('trend_strength', 0) > 0]
    }
    
    # Calculate correlation matrix between strategies
    correlation_matrix = numerix_tools.correlation_analysis.calculate_strategy_correlation(
        strategies=list(strategy_groups.keys()),
        lookback_period=252  # 1 year of daily data
    )
    
    # Run portfolio optimization
    optimization_result = numerix_tools.portfolio_optimization.optimize_risk_budget(
        strategy_returns=[s.get('expected_return', 0) for s in strategy_signals],
        strategy_risks=[s.get('expected_volatility', 0.1) for s in strategy_signals],
        correlation_matrix=correlation_matrix,
        target_volatility=0.12,  # 12% target volatility
        max_strategy_weight=0.3,  # Maximum 30% allocation to any single strategy
        min_strategy_weight=0.0   # Allow complete exclusion of strategies
    )
    
    # Run Monte Carlo simulation to validate portfolio
    simulation_result = numerix_tools.monte_carlo_simulation.simulate_portfolio(

        scenarios=10000,
        confidence_level=0.95
    )
    
    # Create allocation plan
    allocation_plan = []
    for i, weight in enumerate(optimization_result['weights']):
        if weight > 0.01:  # Materiality threshold
            allocation_plan.append({
                'strategy': strategy_signals[i].get('strategy', f'Strategy {i}'),
                'weight': weight,
                'risk_contribution': optimization_result['risk_contribution'][i]
            })
    
    return {
        'agent': 'Risk Budgeter',
        'allocation': allocation_plan,

        'cvar_95': simulation_result['cvar_95'],
        'max_drawdown': simulation_result['max_drawdown']
    }
```

For AWS deployment, the team configured the system to run on a combination of Lambda functions for real-time signal processing and Bedrock AgentCore for the agent intelligence layer:

```python
# AWS Lambda handler for Alternative Risk Premia Collective
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    import json
    import boto3
    
    # Initialize Bedrock client
    bedrock = boto3.client('bedrock-agent')
    
    # Process market data update
    market_data = event.get('market_data', {})
    
    # Prepare request for Bedrock AgentCore
    request = {
        "market_data": market_data,
        "currencies": event.get('currencies', ['USD', 'EUR', 'JPY', 'GBP', 'CHF', 'AUD', 'CAD']),
        "rates_markets": event.get('rates_markets', ['US', 'EU', 'JP', 'UK', 'CH', 'AU', 'CA']),
        "timestamp": event.get('timestamp', '')
    }
    
    # Invoke the Alternative Risk Premia Collective agent
    response = bedrock.invoke_agent(
        agentId='arn:aws:bedrock:us-east-1:123456789012:agent/altRiskPremiaCollective',
        agentAliasId='PROD',
        inputText=json.dumps(request)
    )
    
    # Process the response
    result = json.loads(response['completion'])
    
    # Store results in S3
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.put_object(
        Bucket='quantum-alpha-signals',
        Key=f"risk-premia/{result['timestamp']}/allocation.json",
        Body=json.dumps(result)
    )
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps({
            'message': 'Alternative Risk Premia Collective execution completed',
            'timestamp': result['timestamp'],
            'expected_return': result['expected_return'],
            'expected_volatility': result['expected_volatility']
        })
    }
```

The team also implemented a configuration to deploy the entire system on Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
# Initialize the main application for AgentCore deployment
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Register all agents
app.register_entrypoint("volatility_harvester", volatility_harvester_agent)
app.register_entrypoint("carry_strategist", carry_strategist_agent)
app.register_entrypoint("mean_reversion_detector", mean_reversion_detector_agent)
app.register_entrypoint("momentum_tracker", momentum_tracker_agent)
app.register_entrypoint("risk_budgeter", risk_budgeter_agent)
app.register_entrypoint("collective", alternative_risk_premia_collective)

# Configure memory persistence
app.configure_memory(
    persistence_type="DynamoDB",
    table_name="risk-premia-memory",
    ttl_days=90
)

# Configure observability
app.configure_observability(
    level="INFO",
    export_metrics=True,
    export_traces=True
)

# Run the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

## Result

The Alternative Risk Premia Harvesting Collective successfully implemented their agent-based investment system, deploying it across AWS cloud infrastructure with Bedrock AgentCore providing the intelligence layer. Within the first six months of operation, the system demonstrated significant advantages over the fund's previous approaches. During a period of market turbulence when the VIX spiked from 15 to 35, the collective's volatility harvesting strategies generated outsized returns by dynamically shifting from volatility selling to volatility buying strategies two days before the market recognized the regime shift. The carry strategies automatically reduced exposure to vulnerable currency pairs three weeks before a major carry trade unwind affected the broader market. The mean reversion and momentum agents worked in tandem to exploit short-term dislocations while maintaining exposure to beneficial secular trends.

Most impressively, the Risk Budgeter agent continuously reallocated capital across strategies based on changing correlation structures, maintaining a consistent risk profile even as market dynamics shifted dramatically. The fund achieved an annualized return of 16.3% with volatility of 11.8%, exceeding targets while demonstrating significantly lower drawdowns than comparable multi-strategy funds. The cloud-native infrastructure enabled the system to process over 200 risk premia signals across global markets daily, dynamically adjusting allocations in near real-time. Quantum Alpha Capital's investors were particularly impressed by the system's resilience during stress periods and the transparency provided by the agent-based approach, which allowed for clear attribution of returns to specific risk premia strategies. Based on this success, the firm committed additional capital to expand the platform's capabilities and develop specialized agents for emerging alternative risk premia domains.
