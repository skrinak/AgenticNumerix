## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
Pacific Life Insurance Company managed a $40 billion general account portfolio that required optimization across 25 external fixed income managers. Their existing approach relied heavily on quarterly manager reviews and static strategic allocation, which was proving inadequate in rapidly changing interest rate and credit environments. The company's Chief Investment Officer was concerned that their manual approach to manager allocation was causing suboptimal risk-adjusted returns, with an estimated 40-75 basis points in potential performance being left on the table. They also faced challenges in maintaining appropriate liability matching as interest rates became increasingly volatile, with duration mismatches occasionally exceeding their risk tolerance. The investment team was spending excessive time aggregating and analyzing manager holdings, leaving little capacity for forward-looking strategy. Furthermore, individual managers often operated in silos, unaware of how their strategy complemented or conflicted with other managers in the portfolio. The insurance company needed a more dynamic, data-driven approach to manager allocation that could optimize for both investment returns and liability matching objectives.

### Task
Develop an intelligent multi-agent allocation system capable of dynamically optimizing capital across 25 external fixed income managers and 500+ underlying securities. The system needed to maintain overall duration matching with the company's liability profile while targeting a 4.5% portfolio yield with less than 8% tracking error versus liabilities. It had to withstand diverse stress scenarios including parallel yield curve shifts of Â±300 basis points, steepening/flattening scenarios, credit spread widening up to 200 basis points, manager style drift, and liquidity crunches. The system also needed to provide comprehensive attribution analysis to distinguish manager skill from market beta, enabling data-driven decisions on manager retention and allocation adjustments. This sophisticated allocation engine would need to analyze manager holdings at the security level, assess complementary and overlapping exposures, and maintain a holistic view of the entire portfolio's risk exposures across interest rate, credit, and liquidity dimensions.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we established the core agent framework using Strands Agents SDK and integrated with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK with fixed income analytics modules
nx.initialize(
    license_key=os.environ.get("NUMERIX_LICENSE_KEY"),
    modules=["fixed_income_analytics", "poly_path", "economic_scenario_generator", "liability_driven_investing"]
)

# Create agent network for the fixed income allocation engine
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Multi-Manager Fixed Income Allocation Engine")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent was implemented with specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

### Result

Pacific Life Insurance Company implemented the Multi-Manager Fixed Income Allocation Engine and achieved remarkable improvements in portfolio performance and operational efficiency. Within six months of deployment, the system had optimized allocations across their 25 external fixed income managers, resulting in a 32 basis point improvement in risk-adjusted returns while maintaining tight alignment with liability profiles. The portfolio consistently achieved its 4.5% yield target with tracking error versus liabilities reduced from an average of 9.3% to 6.8%, well within the 8% target threshold.

The Duration Manager agent successfully identified a persistent structural duration gap at the long end of the curve which had previously gone undetected. By reallocating capital toward managers with stronger long-duration capabilities, the system reduced duration mismatch by 57%, significantly decreasing the portfolio's exposure to non-parallel yield curve shifts. This proved particularly valuable during a period of curve steepening when traditional duration matching would have resulted in significant underperformance.

The Credit Selector agent provided unprecedented insights into each manager's credit selection skill, distinguishing between market beta and genuine alpha generation. This led to a reallocation of capital away from three managers whose outperformance had been primarily driven by persistent overweight to BBB credits rather than superior security selection. The freed capital was directed to managers demonstrating consistent alpha generation across varied credit environments, improving the portfolio's credit component of returns by 41 basis points annually with no increase in credit risk.

The Curve Strategist agent's sophisticated decomposition of returns identified opportunities to express curve views more efficiently through targeted manager allocations. When the Fed signaled a potential pause in rate hikes, the system quickly identified and increased allocations to managers with strong track records in steepener trades, positioning the portfolio to benefit from the subsequent curve steepening. This tactical positioning contributed an additional 18 basis points to returns during the subsequent quarter.

The Liquidity Assessor agent created a dynamic liquidity tiering system across the portfolio, ensuring sufficient liquidity to meet liability cash flows even under stressed scenarios while optimizing yield. By identifying complementary liquidity profiles across managers, the system maintained a 12% highly liquid buffer while reducing cash drag. During a period of market volatility in the second quarter of implementation, this liquidity buffer proved invaluable, allowing the portfolio to meet all obligations without forced selling of assets at depressed prices.

The Performance Attributor agent revolutionized how Pacific Life evaluated its external managers. By decomposing performance into granular factors, the company gained unprecedented insight into each manager's persistent skill areas. This led to more targeted manager mandates, focusing each manager on their demonstrated strengths rather than broad market exposure. The system also detected style drift in two managers months before it would have been apparent through traditional quarterly reviews, allowing for early intervention and mandate clarification.

Perhaps most impressively, the allocation engine automatically adjusted to changing market conditions, reallocating capital as relative opportunities shifted. The comprehensive analytics provided senior investment officers with unprecedented visibility into portfolio positioning, allowing for more strategic conversations with external managers. The investment team reported spending 70% less time on manual portfolio analytics and 80% more time on forward-looking strategy and manager evaluation discussions. The company's CIO cited the allocation engine as "transformative to our investment process," noting that it had fundamentally improved how the company deployed its $40 billion general account portfolio.
