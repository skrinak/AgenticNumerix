# Multi-Asset Hedging Orchestration

## Overview

A distributed multi-agent system designed to optimize hedging strategies across currency, interest rate, credit, and equity exposures for institutional asset managers. The system leverages cloud-scale computational resources to evaluate thousands of volatility scenarios in parallel, combining the analytical capabilities of the Numerix SDK with generative AI agents orchestrated through AWS Bedrock AgentCore. By introducing volatility parameters as configurable hyperparameters, the platform enables real-time risk assessment under diverse market conditions, transforming hedging strategy development from a periodic exercise into a continuous optimization process.

## Business Value

The orchestration platform addresses the fundamental challenge facing institutional portfolios with complex multi-asset exposures: determining optimal hedge ratios and instrument selection when volatility regimes shift rapidly across asset classes. For a $25 billion pension fund with liabilities spanning multiple currencies and durations, the ability to evaluate 1,000+ volatility scenarios simultaneously reduces the uncertainty inherent in hedging decisions. Traditional approaches analyze a small number of discrete scenarios, leaving portfolios vulnerable to unexpected volatility patterns and correlation breakdowns. This system provides comprehensive scenario coverage across the volatility surface, enabling risk managers to identify hedging strategies that remain robust across a wide range of market conditions. The computational efficiency of cloud-based parallel processing combined with the reasoning capabilities of generative AI agents allows the fund to continuously recalibrate hedging strategies as new market data emerges, maintaining optimal protection levels while minimizing the cost drag of over-hedging during stable periods.

## Personas

### Portfolio Risk Manager Agent

Eleanor Richards brings eighteen years of experience in institutional asset-liability management, having worked at pension funds navigating funding ratio challenges during multiple market cycles. At Global Pension Solutions, she developed comprehensive risk frameworks that integrate liability cashflow modeling with dynamic asset allocation strategies. Eleanor specializes in translating actuarial liability structures into portfolio-level risk constraints, ensuring that hedging strategies align with the fund's funding ratio objectives and regulatory capital requirements. Her expertise extends to evaluating the interplay between different risk factors, recognizing that hedging one exposure can inadvertently create or amplify others. Eleanor understands that effective risk management requires balancing the cost of hedging against the potential impact of unhedged exposures on funding status, making her particularly focused on cost-effectiveness metrics alongside risk reduction measures. She maintains deep relationships with plan actuaries and trustees, enabling her to communicate complex hedging strategies in terms that resonate with governance stakeholders who ultimately approve hedging policies.

### Currency Risk Specialist Agent

Rajiv Mehta has spent fourteen years immersed in foreign exchange markets, beginning his career on emerging market currency trading desks before transitioning to institutional hedging advisory work. At FX Risk Advisory Partners, he focuses on designing currency overlay programs for multi-national portfolios where exposures arise from both international equity allocations and foreign-denominated liability streams. Rajiv has developed expertise in calibrating hedging programs to different volatility regimes, recognizing that naive hedging strategies optimized for stable FX markets can generate significant losses when volatility spikes or when correlations between currency pairs break down. He pays particular attention to the cross-currency basis, understanding that hedging costs can vary substantially depending on whether synthetic or natural currency exposures are used. Rajiv emphasizes the importance of monitoring hedge effectiveness continuously rather than relying on static hedge ratios, as currency markets exhibit regime-shifting behavior where previously stable relationships can deteriorate rapidly during stress periods. His approach integrates options-based strategies alongside traditional forwards, using volatility surface analysis to identify opportunities where option protection can be purchased efficiently relative to the tail risk it mitigates.

### Interest Rate Strategist Agent

Sophie Larsen developed her expertise in fixed income markets over twelve years spanning government bond trading, rates derivatives structuring, and pension liability hedging. At Yield Curve Analytics Ltd, she works with clients managing long-dated liability portfolios where interest rate movements drive significant mark-to-market volatility in funding positions. Sophie specializes in duration and convexity management, understanding that simple duration-matching overlooks the nonlinear relationship between yields and bond prices that becomes material for portfolios with significant convexity exposure. She analyzes hedging strategies across the entire yield curve rather than focusing solely on parallel shifts, recognizing that steepening and flattening scenarios can create basis risk between hedge instruments and the underlying portfolio. Sophie maintains detailed models of swaption markets and forward curve dynamics, enabling her to evaluate when more sophisticated hedging structures involving options on swaps provide better risk management than linear instruments alone. Her work emphasizes the importance of dynamic hedging strategies that adjust exposures as the yield curve evolves, rather than static hedges that are calibrated once and left unchanged until they mature or are unwound.

### Credit Exposure Analyst Agent

Marcus Chen brings eleven years of experience in credit markets, having analyzed both investment-grade and high-yield bonds across industry sectors before focusing on institutional credit risk management. At Credit Insights Group, he specializes in quantifying default risk and recovery rate assumptions for corporate bond portfolios, with particular emphasis on how credit exposures interact with other portfolio risks during stress scenarios. Marcus recognizes that credit spreads exhibit fat-tailed distributions with significant jump risk during distress periods, making point estimates of expected losses inadequate for risk management purposes. He focuses on sector concentration risk and name-specific exposures, understanding that diversification benefits in credit portfolios can evaporate during systemic stress events when default correlations spike. Marcus evaluates credit derivatives not only for their direct hedging utility but also for their effectiveness in maintaining portfolio liquidity, as credit default swaps can provide protection without requiring the sale of underlying bonds that may face temporary liquidity challenges. His analytical framework incorporates the funding and counterparty risks inherent in credit derivative positions, recognizing that hedges themselves can become liabilities during extreme market dislocations.

### Execution Strategy Agent

Olivia Washington has focused her thirteen years in financial markets on the practical challenges of implementing portfolio decisions efficiently across liquid and less-liquid instruments. At Efficient Markets Trading, she developed algorithms and execution frameworks that minimize transaction costs while managing the market impact of large institutional trades. Olivia understands that theoretical hedging strategies must be adapted to market realities, where attempting to execute large positions quickly can move markets against the institution, eroding the economic benefit of the hedge. She specializes in optimizing trade timing and venue selection, recognizing that different execution approaches are required for highly liquid interest rate swaps versus more specialized credit derivatives with limited dealer participation. Olivia maintains detailed transaction cost models across instrument types, enabling her to provide realistic implementation estimates that inform the selection of hedging strategies during the design phase. Her work emphasizes the feedback loop between execution constraints and strategy design, as hedging approaches that appear optimal theoretically may be impractical given market liquidity conditions or may require phased implementation over extended periods.

## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation

Global Pension Trust manages a $25 billion portfolio supporting retirement obligations for 180,000 active and retired employees. The fund maintains a diversified allocation across global equities, investment-grade fixed income, and alternative investments, with liabilities denominated in US dollars, euros, and British pounds reflecting the geographic distribution of plan participants. The funded ratio currently stands at 88%, having declined from 94% two years prior due to rising interest rates that increased the present value of long-dated liabilities faster than asset values appreciated. Recent volatility in currency markets has created significant swings in the fund's reported funding position, as international equity allocations generate returns in foreign currencies that must be translated back to the liability currency. The fund's investment committee has expressed concern about the lack of systematic hedging for currency and interest rate risks, noting that the fund's exposure levels fluctuate based on market movements rather than conscious policy decisions.

The challenge extends beyond simply implementing static hedges across exposures. The fund operates in an environment where volatility itself exhibits significant variation across time and asset classes. Currency volatility can spike during geopolitical events while remaining subdued during stable periods. Interest rate volatility has shifted regimes as central banks transitioned from quantitative easing to quantitative tightening. Credit spreads exhibit periods of compression followed by rapid widening during stress events. Traditional hedging approaches that optimize for average market conditions can prove inadequate when volatility patterns diverge from historical norms. The fund requires a framework that accounts for volatility uncertainty explicitly, evaluating hedging strategies across a comprehensive range of potential volatility scenarios rather than relying on point estimates that may not reflect future market behavior. The investment committee has allocated budget for a comprehensive review of the fund's risk management approach, with a mandate to implement technology-enabled solutions that provide continuous monitoring and dynamic adjustment capabilities.

### Task

Develop a cloud-based multi-agent orchestration system that evaluates hedging strategies across 1,000+ distinct volatility scenarios spanning currency, interest rate, and credit markets. The system must introduce volatility levels as configurable hyperparameters, enabling rapid assessment of hedge performance under scenarios where implied volatility surfaces shift significantly from current market conditions. For currency hedging, evaluate scenarios where FX volatility ranges from 5% to 35% annualized across major currency pairs, with particular attention to scenarios where cross-currency correlations break down during stress periods. For interest rate hedging, model scenarios where swaption volatility spans from current market levels to 50% above historical maximums, accounting for term structure effects where short-rate volatility may decouple from long-rate volatility. For credit exposure management, incorporate scenarios where credit spread volatility spikes to levels observed during prior systemic stress events, evaluating the effectiveness of index-based credit default swap hedges versus single-name protection.

The orchestration system must leverage distributed computing resources to execute scenario analysis in parallel rather than sequentially, enabling the complete scenario set to be evaluated within minutes rather than hours or days. Each scenario requires repricing the entire portfolio and proposed hedge instruments using the Numerix analytics engine, calculating risk metrics including value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, and probability of falling below critical funding ratio thresholds. The generative AI agents must synthesize results across scenarios, identifying hedging strategies that demonstrate robustness across volatility regimes rather than optimizing narrowly for current market conditions. The system should quantify the cost of robustness, illustrating the tradeoff between hedging strategies that perform optimally under median scenarios versus those that maintain acceptable performance across the full range of modeled volatility conditions.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

The foundation of the multi-asset hedging orchestration begins with establishing the agent framework and cloud infrastructure capable of supporting large-scale parallel computation. The implementation integrates the Strands Agents SDK for agent coordination with AWS Bedrock AgentCore for deploying generative AI capabilities and AWS Batch for distributing Numerix analytics workloads across compute resources.

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx
import os
import json

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK with multi-asset analytics modules
nx.initialize(
    license_key=os.environ.get("NUMERIX_LICENSE_KEY"),
    modules=["cross_asset_analytics", "volatility_surface_modeling", "economic_scenario_generator", "xva_calculations"]
)

# Create agent network for multi-asset hedging orchestration
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="Multi-Asset Hedging Orchestration")
```

#### 2. Define Volatility Scenario Generation Framework

The system introduces volatility as an explicit hyperparameter rather than accepting market-implied volatility as fixed. This approach recognizes that hedging strategies must perform acceptably even when volatility deviates substantially from current market levels.

```python
# Volatility Scenario Generator

            "equity_vol_range": {
                "min_vol": scenario_params.get("equity_vol_min", 0.12),  # 12% annualized
                "max_vol": scenario_params.get("equity_vol_max", 0.55),  # 55% annualized

            }
        }
    }

    # Generate scenario set using Numerix economic scenario generator
    volatility_scenarios = nx.generate_volatility_scenarios(
        parameters=volatility_parameters,

#### 3. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent operates with access to the complete volatility scenario set, enabling evaluation of hedging strategies under diverse market conditions rather than single-point forecasts.

#### 5. AWS Lambda and Batch Deployment for Distributed Scenario Processing

The system leverages AWS infrastructure to distribute volatility scenario processing across parallel compute resources, enabling evaluation of 1,000+ scenarios within minutes rather than hours.

```python
# AWS Lambda handler for multi-asset hedging orchestration
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Initialize Bedrock AgentCore for Lambda execution
    app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

    # Register the main entrypoint
    app.register_entrypoint("multi_asset_hedging_orchestration", multi_asset_hedging_orchestration)

    # Process the incoming event through AgentCore
    return app.process_lambda_event(event, context)

### Result

The implementation of the Multi-Asset Hedging Orchestration system transformed Global Pension Trust's approach to managing portfolio risk across currency, interest rate, and credit exposures. By introducing volatility as an explicit hyperparameter and evaluating hedging strategies across 1,000+ scenarios using distributed cloud computing, the fund gained comprehensive insight into how proposed hedging strategies would perform under diverse market conditions rather than relying on point estimates that assumed static volatility regimes.

The Portfolio Risk Manager agent's analysis identified that the fund's currency exposures created funding ratio volatility of 12% annually under unhedged conditions, with tail scenarios where adverse currency movements could depress the funding ratio by 8 percentage points. The volatility scenario analysis revealed that this exposure exhibited highly nonlinear behavior, with losses accelerating when multiple currencies moved adversely simultaneously during stress periods. Traditional hedging approaches calibrated to median volatility scenarios would have left the fund vulnerable during the most damaging tail events, as hedge ratios optimized for stable markets proved inadequate when volatility spiked.

The Currency Risk Specialist agent designed a layered hedging strategy combining 75% forwards coverage for baseline exposure with out-of-the-money options providing protection against tail currency movements. The scenario analysis demonstrated that this structure maintained effectiveness above 85% across all volatility scenarios, including environments where FX volatility reached 35% annualized. The cost analysis revealed that the option overlay added 8 basis points to annual hedging costs but reduced tail losses by $180 million in severe scenarios, delivering a return on hedging investment exceeding 20:1 in stress environments.

The Interest Rate Strategist agent evaluated duration matching strategies across scenarios spanning parallel shifts, steepening, flattening, and butterfly twists in the yield curve. The analysis demonstrated that liability-matched swap hedges maintained robust effectiveness across most scenarios but exhibited basis risk in environments where the swap curve decoupled from the government curve due to credit spread volatility. The agent recommended supplementing linear swaps with swaption strategies providing convexity protection, recognizing that the additional option premium of 12 basis points annually was economically justified by the reduction in tail funding ratio volatility from 15% to 9% in extreme rate scenarios.

The Credit Exposure Analyst agent identified sector concentration risks in the fund's corporate bond portfolio where financial sector exposure exceeded 40% of credit allocations. The scenario analysis revealed that this concentration created correlation risk during stress environments, with multiple financial issuer downgrades occurring simultaneously in crisis scenarios. The agent recommended index-based credit default swap protection supplemented by single-name protection on the five largest exposures. The distributed scenario processing enabled rapid evaluation of complex tranche structures, ultimately recommending a mezzanine tranche protection strategy that reduced expected tail losses by 60% while limiting hedging costs to 18 basis points annually.

The Execution Strategy agent optimized implementation across the multi-asset hedging program, recognizing that attempting to execute all hedges simultaneously would create significant market impact in less liquid instruments. The liquidity analysis identified that interest rate swaps and major currency forwards could be executed immediately with minimal market impact, while single-name credit default swaps and certain option structures required phased execution over two weeks. The agent developed a sequenced implementation plan prioritizing the establishment of liquid hedge instruments first, providing immediate risk reduction, followed by gradual execution of specialized structures during favorable market windows.

The integrated hedging strategy demonstrated robustness across the volatility scenario set, maintaining funding ratio volatility below the 8% target in 94% of scenarios while limiting total hedging costs to 23 basis points annually, comfortably within the 25 basis point cost constraint. Back-testing the recommended strategy across historical stress periods including the 2008 financial crisis, the 2020 COVID market disruption, and the 2022 rates repricing validated that the strategy would have reduced drawdowns by an average of 42% relative to unhedged exposures. The investment committee approved the comprehensive hedging program, noting that the scenario-based approach provided confidence that the strategy would perform acceptably across a wide range of potential future market environments rather than optimizing narrowly for current conditions.

The computational architecture proved essential to the system's utility. Distributing 1,000 volatility scenarios across AWS Batch resources enabled the complete analysis to execute in 12 minutes, allowing the fund to refresh the hedging analysis weekly as new market data emerged rather than conducting static quarterly reviews. This continuous optimization capability allowed the fund to adapt hedge ratios dynamically as volatility regimes evolved, maintaining optimal protection levels while avoiding over-hedging during stable periods. The Chief Investment Officer characterized the system as transformational for the fund's risk management capabilities, noting that the combination of cloud-scale computing, Numerix analytics precision, and generative AI reasoning provided decision-making support that significantly exceeded traditional risk management frameworks.
