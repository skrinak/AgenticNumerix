# Alternative Risk Premia Strategy Stress Universe

## Overview
A sophisticated multi-agent system designed for stress testing alternative risk premia (ARP) strategies across diverse market regimes. This system orchestrates specialized agents with expertise in risk premia modeling, stress scenario generation, strategy correlation analysis, and portfolio construction to help multi-manager platforms identify vulnerabilities in their ARP strategies. By testing investment approaches across 500+ market regime scenarios focusing on volatility risk premium collapse, carry trade unwinds, momentum crashes, and mean reversion failures, the system enables managers to build more resilient portfolios, implement targeted drawdown controls, and better diversify strategy allocations across different market environments.

## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
Prisma Alternative Investments (PAI), a multi-manager platform with $8.5 billion allocated to alternative risk premia strategies across 22 external managers and 7 internally managed portfolios, had experienced an unexpected period of underperformance. Despite years of careful strategy selection and risk management, their flagship Alternative Risk Premia Fund had suffered a 14% drawdown over an eight-week periodâ€”significantly exceeding the 8% maximum drawdown indicated in their investor materials. Post-analysis revealed that strategies that had historically exhibited low or negative correlations suddenly moved in tandem during the market dislocation, nullifying the diversification benefits that were central to their investment thesis. This correlation breakdown occurred across multiple strategy types, with value, momentum, and carry strategies all experiencing simultaneous losses despite their theoretical diversification. The situation was particularly concerning as several sophisticated institutional investors, including three major pension funds, had explicitly allocated to the fund based on its promised diversification benefits and controlled drawdown profile. The firm's CIO was facing difficult questions from the investment committee about the robustness of their strategy selection and portfolio construction approach. Meanwhile, the risk management team was struggling to explain why their stress testing framework had failed to anticipate this type of correlated drawdown. With investor redemption notices beginning to arrive and the quarterly investor meeting approaching in six weeks, PAI needed to quickly develop a more comprehensive understanding of how their diverse alternative risk premia strategies could break down simultaneously and implement enhanced portfolio construction techniques to prevent similar occurrences in the future.

### Task
Develop a sophisticated Alternative Risk Premia Strategy Stress Universe capable of testing investment approaches across 500+ market regime scenarios with particular focus on correlation breakdowns, strategy-specific vulnerabilities, and portfolio construction resilience. The system needed to generate realistic stress scenarios that captured known ARP strategy vulnerabilities including volatility risk premium collapse, carry trade unwinds, momentum crashes, and mean reversion failures. It had to analyze how strategy correlations evolved under different market conditions, identifying potential correlation regime shifts before they manifested in performance. The solution needed to decompose strategy returns into their underlying risk factors, revealing hidden exposures and potential crowding risks across managers. Additionally, it needed to develop enhanced portfolio construction methodologies that explicitly incorporated stress test results, optimizing for resilience across diverse market environments rather than just historical performance patterns. The system had to integrate with PAI's existing risk management infrastructure and provide actionable insights for strategy selection, allocation decisions, and risk mitigation techniques. The goal was to create a framework that would not only explain the recent drawdown but provide forward-looking protection against similar events while maintaining the attractive risk-adjusted returns that investors expected from alternative risk premia strategies.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we established the core agent framework by integrating Strands Agents SDK with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx
import os
import json

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK with alternative risk premia and stress testing modules
nx.initialize(
    license_key=os.environ.get("NUMERIX_LICENSE_KEY"),
    modules=["alt_risk_premia", "stress_testing", "correlation_analytics", "portfolio_construction"]
)

# Create agent network for the Alternative Risk Premia Strategy Stress Universe
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="ARP Strategy Stress Universe")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent was implemented with specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

### Result

The implementation of the Alternative Risk Premia Strategy Stress Universe system transformed Prisma Alternative Investments' approach to risk management and portfolio construction, delivering both immediate analytical insights and long-term strategic advantages. Within the first month of deployment, the system provided a comprehensive explanation of the recent drawdown that had perplexed both management and investors.

The Alternative Risk Premia Specialist agent's sophisticated decomposition of strategy returns revealed hidden factor exposures that weren't evident in PAI's traditional risk reports. Most significantly, the agent discovered that despite their diverse implementations and theoretical underpinnings, many of the fund's strategies shared significant exposure to an implicit "liquidity premium" factor that became negatively correlated with performance during market stress. The agent also identified strategy capacity constraints that had been exceeded in several popular trades, particularly in the equity market-neutral space where crowding had amplified losses during the market dislocation. These insights led PAI to implement more sophisticated capacity monitoring and diversification across implementation approaches, even when strategies shared the same theoretical risk premium.

The Stress Scenario Architect agent developed a comprehensive universe of 547 stress scenarios that went far beyond traditional historical simulations. Particularly valuable were the synthetic scenarios designed specifically to target the vulnerabilities of alternative risk premia strategies, including scenarios modeling the simultaneous unwinding of carry trades across asset classes and the breakdown of mean-reversion patterns during regime shifts. The agent's liquidity modeling revealed how transaction costs could amplify losses during stress periods, with certain strategies experiencing up to 4x normal trading costs when unwinding positions during market dislocations. This led to the implementation of liquidity-aware position sizing and the development of staged reduction protocols for stress events, significantly reducing the potential impact of future liquidity spirals.

The Strategy Correlation Analyst agent identified five distinct correlation regimes that characterized how ARP strategies interacted under different market conditions. Most critically, the agent's analysis revealed that during "risk-off" environments triggered by unexpected macro events, correlation patterns would rapidly shift from their historical norms, with previously diversifying strategies suddenly moving in tandem. The agent's network analysis uncovered clusters of strategies that appeared diverse on the surface but shared hidden connectedness during stress periods. These insights led to a complete restructuring of PAI's diversification approach, moving from simple strategy-type diversification to a more sophisticated framework based on underlying factor exposures and stress behavior, significantly enhancing portfolio resilience.

The Portfolio Construction Strategist agent developed innovative approaches to enhance portfolio resilience while maintaining attractive return characteristics. The agent designed a multi-layered optimization framework that explicitly incorporated stress scenario performance alongside traditional risk-return metrics, creating portfolios that sacrificed a small amount of Sharpe ratio in normal markets in exchange for significantly reduced drawdown risk during stress periods. Particularly valuable was the agent's development of complementary strategy combinations where certain strategies were explicitly included as "stress hedges" for others, even if they reduced portfolio efficiency during normal markets. The agent also designed a sophisticated drawdown control system with dynamic allocation adjustments triggered by early warning indicators of potential correlation regime shifts, providing an additional layer of protection against extreme events.

Beyond the specific analytical insights, the system transformed how PAI communicated with investors about alternative risk premia strategies. The comprehensive investor presentation developed from the system's analyses became the centerpiece of PAI's quarterly investor meeting, providing clear explanations of the recent drawdown, specific enhancements to the investment process, and realistic expectations for future performance across different market environments. The visualizations of correlation dynamics and portfolio construction enhancements were particularly effective in rebuilding investor confidence, leading several large institutional investors to maintain or even increase their allocations despite the recent underperformance.

The long-term impact was evident when markets experienced another period of volatility six months later. While competitor funds suffered drawdowns similar to their previous experience, PAI's enhanced portfolio construction and risk management approach limited their drawdown to just 40% of what would have occurred with their previous methodology. This real-world validation of the system's insights led to increased allocations from existing investors and interest from new institutions impressed by the firm's sophisticated approach to alternative risk premia investing. The system's ongoing monitoring capabilities have allowed PAI to continuously refine their strategy selection and positioning, creating a dynamic investment process that adapts as market structures evolve, ultimately positioning the firm as a leader in institutional alternative risk premia investing.
