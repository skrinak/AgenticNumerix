## Personas

### Credit Risk Modeling Specialist Agent
**Name:** Dr. Amara Okafor  
**Background:** 14+ years in quantitative credit risk modeling and statistical analysis  
**Company:** Quantitative Credit Solutions  
**Responsibilities:**
Dr. Okafor specializes in developing sophisticated probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) models that meet IFRS 9 requirements for point-in-time estimates and lifetime horizons. She designs and calibrates credit risk models across diverse asset classes including corporate loans, retail mortgages, credit cards, and specialized lending products. Dr. Okafor develops methodologies for calculating 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses with appropriate discount factors, incorporates forward-looking information into risk parameter estimates, and designs approaches for capturing non-linear relationships between macroeconomic factors and credit performance. She leads model validation and backtesting exercises to ensure predictive power across economic cycles and continuously refines model segmentation to improve risk differentiation while maintaining statistical power. Dr. Okafor also develops methodologies for significant increase in credit risk (SICR) assessment that drive accurate stage allocation under IFRS 9.

### Macroeconomic Scenario Generator Agent
**Name:** Michael Santiago  
**Background:** 12 years in economic forecasting and stress testing  
**Company:** EconScenario Analytics  
**Responsibilities:**
Michael focuses on developing comprehensive macroeconomic scenario frameworks for IFRS 9 expected credit loss modeling. He designs base, upside, and downside scenarios with appropriate probability weightings that reflect current economic conditions and forward-looking information. Michael maintains econometric models that link macroeconomic variables to credit risk parameters across different sectors and geographies, develops approaches for capturing emerging economic risks and structural changes, and conducts sensitivity analysis of provisions to changes in economic assumptions. He integrates market-implied forecasts with econometric models to create coherent scenarios, ensures scenarios are updated regularly to reflect changing economic conditions, and develops early warning indicators for potential economic deterioration. Michael also designs specialized scenarios for concentration risks in the portfolio and maintains comprehensive documentation of scenario methodologies for regulatory and audit purposes.

### Portfolio Optimization Specialist Agent
**Name:** Sophia Lee  
**Background:** 10 years in credit portfolio management and optimization  
**Company:** Strategic Portfolio Advisors  
**Responsibilities:**
Sophia specializes in analyzing how portfolio composition affects IFRS 9 provisions and capital consumption. She develops analytical frameworks to evaluate the sensitivity of different portfolio segments to IFRS 9 parameters, designs optimization strategies for credit origination limits based on expected loss impacts, and creates portfolio diversification strategies that reduce concentration risks while maintaining returns. Sophia conducts vintage analysis to identify performing and underperforming cohorts, develops strategies for managing problematic segments with elevated expected credit losses, and analyzes the impact of different business growth strategies on future provisions. She designs early intervention strategies for segments showing early signs of credit deterioration, develops risk-adjusted performance metrics that incorporate expected credit loss impacts, and works with business units to implement portfolio strategies that balance growth with risk considerations.

### Accounting and Disclosure Expert Agent
**Name:** Robert Keller  
**Background:** 15 years in financial accounting, regulatory reporting, and disclosure  
**Company:** IFRS Advisory Group  
**Responsibilities:**
Robert focuses on ensuring that credit loss modeling approaches comply with IFRS 9 accounting standards and disclosure requirements. He develops comprehensive IFRS 9 disclosure frameworks that explain expected credit loss calculations, evaluates modeling approaches for compliance with accounting standards, and ensures appropriate treatment of post-model adjustments and overlays. Robert designs governance frameworks for IFRS 9 models and processes, evaluates the reasonableness of economic scenarios and probability weights, and develops approaches for explaining provision volatility to stakeholders. He ensures integration between accounting systems and risk models, prepares documentation for auditors and regulators explaining methodology choices, and develops approaches for reconciling regulatory and accounting views of credit losses. Robert also conducts comparative analysis with peer institutions to benchmark provision levels and creates clear narratives explaining provision changes for financial statements.

## User Story (STAR Format)

### Situation
National Commercial Bank (NCB), a mid-sized commercial bank with $85 billion in assets and operations across three countries, faced significant challenges with its IFRS 9 implementation. Two years after the initial adoption of the standard, the bank was still struggling with high volatility in quarterly provisions, unexpected stage migrations that surprised management, and growing concern from auditors about the limited scenario capabilities of their ECL models. The bank's existing approach relied on a small team of analysts using spreadsheet-based models that could only process a handful of scenarios at a time, making comprehensive sensitivity analysis impossible. This led to excessive reliance on post-model adjustments, which had grown to over 15% of total provisionsâ€”a red flag for both auditors and regulators. Furthermore, the bank's business units were making credit decisions without a clear understanding of how new originations would impact IFRS 9 provisions, leading to suboptimal portfolio composition and higher-than-necessary capital consumption. Senior management was under increasing pressure from the board audit committee and external stakeholders to enhance their ECL methodology, improve forward-looking capabilities, and better integrate IFRS 9 considerations into business decisions. Complicating matters further, the bank had recently expanded into a new geographical region with different economic dynamics, and existing models were not calibrated for this market.

### Task
Develop a comprehensive IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss Modeler Engine capable of generating ECL estimates across 1000+ forward-looking scenarios to enable more accurate provisions, better sensitivity analysis, and enhanced strategic decision-making. The system needed to incorporate sophisticated credit risk models tailored to the bank's diverse portfolio, generate and analyze multiple macroeconomic scenarios, optimize portfolio composition through targeted origination limits, and ensure full compliance with accounting standards and disclosure requirements. It had to support granular analysis of provisions by stage, sector, geography, and vintage, with particular focus on identifying emerging credit risks before they materialized in performance data. The solution needed to significantly reduce reliance on post-model adjustments, provide auditable and well-documented methodologies, and enable business units to understand the IFRS 9 impact of their credit decisions. Additionally, the system needed to integrate with the bank's existing systems, operate efficiently across the entire $65 billion loan portfolio, and generate comprehensive reporting for multiple stakeholders including senior management, auditors, regulators, and business line heads.

### Action

#### 1. Implementation Using Numerix SDK, Bedrock AgentCore, and Strands Agents

First, we established the core agent framework by integrating Strands Agents SDK with Bedrock AgentCore:

```python
from strands import Agent, AgentNetwork
from bedrock_agentcore import BedrockAgentCoreApp
import numerix_sdk as nx
import os
import json

# Initialize Bedrock AgentCore application
app = BedrockAgentCoreApp()

# Configure Numerix SDK with IFRS 9 and credit risk modules
nx.initialize(
    license_key=os.environ.get("NUMERIX_LICENSE_KEY"),
    modules=["ifrs9_analytics", "credit_risk", "economic_scenario_generator", "portfolio_analytics"]
)

# Create agent network for the IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss Modeler Engine
agent_network = AgentNetwork(name="IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss Modeler Engine")
```

#### 2. Define Specialized Agent Functions

Each agent was implemented with specialized capabilities leveraging the Numerix SDK:

### Result

The implementation of the IFRS 9 Expected Credit Loss Modeler Engine transformed National Commercial Bank's approach to credit risk management and provisioning, delivering both immediate and strategic benefits across the organization. Within the first quarter of deployment, the system demonstrated its value by generating comprehensive ECL calculations across 1000+ scenarios that revealed previously hidden risk pockets in the portfolio and enabled more proactive management.

One of the most significant achievements was the reduction in post-model adjustments from over 15% to just 3.5% of total provisions. This dramatic improvement was achieved through the Credit Risk Modeling Specialist agent's sophisticated segmentation approach, which identified 42 distinct portfolio segments with homogeneous risk characteristics, allowing for more accurate and granular modeling. The agent's implementation of advanced probability of default models incorporating both traditional and alternative data sources improved predictive power by over 30% compared to previous models, particularly for the bank's recently acquired international portfolio where limited historical data had been a significant challenge.

The Macroeconomic Scenario Generator agent revolutionized NCB's approach to forward-looking information by developing a comprehensive suite of 1,250 scenarios encompassing various economic trajectories. This enabled the bank to move beyond the simplistic three-scenario approach they had been using previously and better capture tail risks and non-linear relationships between economic factors and credit losses. The agent's sophisticated variable selection and correlation modeling ensured internal consistency across scenarios and created a clear audit trail explaining probability weights for regulators and auditors. When a potential economic downturn appeared on the horizon in one of the bank's operating regions, the system quickly generated targeted stress scenarios that helped business lines proactively adjust credit policies months before competitors recognized the emerging risk.

Perhaps the most transformative impact came from the Portfolio Optimization Specialist agent's analysis of concentration risks and vintage performance. The agent identified several industry sectors where the bank had been significantly underestimating lifetime expected credit losses due to inadequate forward-looking adjustments. By analyzing vintage performance across different origination cohorts, the system revealed that loans originated during certain economic conditions exhibited systematically different performance patterns that weren't captured in previous models. This led to the implementation of targeted origination limits for high-risk segments, shifting the portfolio composition toward more resilient sectors without sacrificing overall returns. Within six months, the bank had improved its risk-adjusted return on capital for new originations by 65 basis points while simultaneously reducing expected credit loss volatility by 22%.

The Accounting and Disclosure Expert agent created comprehensive documentation and disclosure materials that transformed the bank's interaction with auditors and regulators. The detailed audit trails, assumption justifications, and sensitivity analyses provided unprecedented transparency into the ECL calculation process. During the first regulatory examination after implementation, the bank received commendation for its "exemplary provisioning framework" â€“ a striking contrast to previous examinations where documentation deficiencies had been noted. The agent's design of an executive dashboard with intuitive visualizations helped senior management understand key ECL drivers and trends, improving strategic decision-making around portfolio growth and risk appetite.

Overall, the system enabled NCB to achieve more accurate, defensible, and forward-looking provisions while simultaneously optimizing its portfolio composition to improve resilience to economic downturns. The quarterly provision process that had previously taken three weeks of intensive manual effort was now completed in just two days with greater accuracy and transparency. Business units began incorporating ECL impact analysis into their origination decisions, creating a more integrated approach to managing credit risk and provisions. Following this success, the bank extended the system to incorporate stress testing for capital planning and strategic forecasting, creating a unified framework for credit risk that spanned regulatory, accounting, and strategic business needs.
